ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
“The Martha, David, and Bagby Lennox Foundation”
This seminar series was made possible by the generous support of the 
Martha, David, and Bagby Lennox Foundation. This foundation, which 
has funded three permanent endowments at Trinity over the years, 
has a rich history with the University. Although the Foundation was 
established in 1985 in Houston, its founders and their family have been 
connected to Trinity since its founding in the 1800s.
The Foundation is named for three siblings, now deceased, who were all 
born in Clarksville and all graduated from Trinity when it was located 
in Waxahachie. Their father and grandfather, C. D. Lennox, Sr. and A. 
J. Latimer, both served as Trinity trustees in the University’s early years. 
Albert H. Latimer, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence 
and the great grandfather of Martha, David, and Bagby, was one of the 
founders of Trinity University.
The three siblings never married and lived together in Clarksville for many 
years. Much of their wealth was derived from cattle and cotton, raised on 
14,000 acres in Red River County and elsewhere, and the eventual sale of 
that land and its oil and mineral rights.
Today, the foundation trustees include Sam Lennox Hocker, a 1970 
Trinity graduate, as well as William Streng, and Mary Clark. The 
Foundation gives to educational and environmental causes as well as to 
animal welfare, historic preservation, and social and human services. The 
Foundation’s giving remains focused primarily in Texas.

AARON DELWICHE
“The Lennox Seminar on Reality Hackers”
In his landmark work Imagined Communities (1991), the cultural critic 
Benedict Anderson argued that media shape our collective identities by 
situating us within perceived territorial and cultural boundaries. Despite 
the fact that most people only engage in face-to-face interaction with a 
small percentage of their fellow citizens, they are able to conceptualize 
themselves as participants in far-flung national communities. According 
to Anderson, the rise of these “imagined communities” known as nation 
states was directly related to the enabling support of the printing press. 
This may have seemed like a bold claim when Anderson first floated his 
thesis in the early 1980s, but his ideas about “imagined communities” 
anticipated the rise of Internet-enabled virtual communities in the 1990s. 
Today, as digital communication technologies penetrate the nooks and 
crannies of our daily lives, Anderson’s thesis is more compelling than ever. 
Our communication tools shape our perception of reality, and the power 
of these devices is growing at an exponential rate. 
For the better part of four decades, computer processing power has been 
doubling every two years, a phenomenon that is sometimes referred to 
as Moore’s Law. This blistering speed—this accelerating rate of change—
transforms human interaction and the human body. Today’s Internet has 
evolved far beyond the clunky tool that fueled the dot.com boom. We 
now have access to virtual worlds, on-line social networks, user-generated 
knowledge bases, collaborative tagging, grass-roots video broadcasting, 
home genomics and geographical information systems. 
Already, many of these applications are enabling the creation of 
transnational businesses (big and small) and activist groups that leverage 
the brainpower of ordinary people across national boundaries. Just as the 
printing press gave rise to the nation state, these emerging technologies 
reshape collective identities and challenge our understanding of what it 
means to be human. 
These are exciting times, but they can also be disorienting. Faced with 
such dizzying developments, many citizens eventually throw up their 
hands and decide it is too difficult to keep up with the changes. This 
is a serious problem. The danger is not that people consciously choose 
to resist the lure of the latest, smallest, fastest gadgets. Indeed, there 
are plenty of good reasons to avoid being swept up with the flow of 
technology. The real problem is the fact that so many people consciously 
remove themselves from public dialogue about the cultural and political 
implications of new technology. This willingness to “let the experts 
decide” is a recipe for technocracy. 
Should citizens have the right to be truly anonymous on-line? Should 
we be concerned about the fact that so many people are choosing to 
build relationships in virtual worlds rather than local neighborhoods? 
Are injectable microscopic radio-frequency ID chips a blessing or a 
curse? Is the use of cognitive enhancing nootropics a human right or an 
0.1 Benedict Anderson’s Imagined 
Communities. According to Anderson, 
nations are “imagined because the members 
of even the smallest nation will never 
know most of their fellow-members, meet 
them, or even hear of them, yet in the 
minds of each lives the image of their 
communion” (pp. 6-7). See: Anderson, 
B. R. O. (1991). Imagined communities: 
Reflections on the origin and spread of 
nationalism. London: Verso.

unforgivable transgression? Should genomic data about human beings 
be hidden away with commercial patents or open-sourced like computer 
software? Should hobbyists known as “biohackers” be allowed to 
experiment with genetic engineering in their own home laboratories? 
The time-frame for acting on such questions is relatively short, and these 
decisions are too important to be left up to a small handful of scientists 
and policy makers. If democracy is to continue as a viable alternative to 
technocracy, the average citizen must become more involved in these 
debates. To borrow a line from the computer visionary Ted Nelson: all of 
us can—and must—understand technology now. 
In an attempt to better understand these issues, Trinity University’s 
Department of Communication invited five guest speakers to participate 
in a semester-long seminar series titled “Reality hackers: The next wave of 
media revolutionaries.” 
“Wait just a moment,” you ask. “Hackers? Why would a nationally 
respected institution such as Trinity University invite hackers to speak on 
campus?” 
Good question.
Although popular stereotypes paint hackers as criminal sociopaths, the 
hacking subculture has played an essential role in the growth of the 
personal computer industry. As Steven Levy noted in his classic work 
Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (1984), many hackers are 
motivated by what he terms “the hacker ethic.” These core principles 
include a commitment to sharing, openness, decentralization, public 
access to information, and the use of new technologies to make the world 
a better place. 
In a retrospective for the April 2010 issue of Wired Magazine, Levy 
reaffirmed his belief that “hackers—brilliant programmers who discovered 
worlds of possibility within the coded confines of a computer—were the 
key players in a sweeping digital transformation. . . [T]heir playfulness, 
as well as their blithe disregard for what others said was impossible, led 
to the breakthroughs that would define the computing experience for 
millions of people.” 
Consider some of the key players: MIT computer science students. The 
Homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley. Stewart Brand (editor of the 
Whole Earth Catalog). Bill Gates. Steve Wozniak. Tim O’ Reilly. Richard 
Stallman. 
These people and projects were all part of the hacker movement. 
Conducting follow-up interviews twenty-five years later, Levy found that 
many of these people still consider themselves to be hackers. 
In a powerful conclusion to his hacking retrospective, Levy reports that 
Bill Gates says he would be “hacking biology” if he were a teenager today. 
“Creating artificial life with DNA synthesis,” Gates tells Levy. “That’s 
0.2 Hackers and the rise of personal 
computing. Steven Levy’s ground breaking 
work was an instant classic. A 25th 
anniversary edition will be published by 
O’ Reilly Press later this year. See: 
Levy, S. (1994). Hackers: Heroes of the 
computer revolution. London: Penguin.
0.3 Geek power. In the May 2010 issue of 
Wired Magazine, Levy conducted follow-up 
interviews with many of the visionaries 
profiled in Hackers: Heroes of the computer 
revolution.

sort of the equivalent of machine-language programming. If you want 
to change the world in some big way, that’s where you should start—
biological molecules. There are more opportunities, now, but they’re 
different opportunities. They need the same type of crazy fanaticism of 
youthful genius and naïveté that drove the PC industry—and can have 
the same impact on the human condition.” 
Levy and Gates—along with many other pioneers in the computing, 
biotechnology and creative industries—understand that it is not insulting 
to call someone a “hacker.” In fact, to those in the know, it’s one of the 
highest forms of praise. 
The five guest speakers who participated in the Lennox seminars also 
understand this. Each one of these thinkers is committed to demystifying 
technology and empowering the human imagination. Each thinker 
pursues intellectual and creative projects that challenge conventional 
understandings of mediated reality and human consciousness. 
Steven Shaviro, the DeRoy Professor of English at Wayne State 
University, was the first guest. Described as “one of our most exciting and 
innovative cultural theorists,” Shaviro may be best known for his books 
Doom Patrols: A Theoretical Fiction about Postmodernism and Connected: 
Or What It Means to Live in the Network Society. In these playful, poetic 
works, Shaviro demonstrates that seemingly innocuous cultural texts–
from Disney robots and comic books to video games and B-movies–have 
much to teach us about the human (and post-human) condition in this 
new century.
Shaviro delivered a compelling public lecture titled “Some years from 
this exact moment: Neveldin/Taylor’s Gamer and the control society.” 
He also met separately with the Lennox seminar students and shared his 
most recent research on how converging communication technologies are 
transforming cinema, television, and music videos. 
A few weeks later, Annalee Newitz arrived on the Trinity University 
campus. Editor-in-chief of the science fiction blog io9, her work has 
been published in Popular Science, The Believer, New Scientist, Wired 
Magazine, and Wall Street Journal. She is a fellow-traveler in the emerging 
biopunk movement who argues passionately on behalf of open-sourced 
genomic databases. She is also the coeditor of the anthology She’s Such 
A Geek: Women Write About Science, Technology, and Other Nerdy Stuff,
a “hopeful book that looks forward to the day when women will invent 
molecular motors, design the next ultra-tiny supercomputer, and run the 
government.”
In her public lecture “Curse of the meatsack: Biohacking, immortality and 
science fiction,” Newitz posed compelling questions to transhumanists 
who hope to use advanced medical techniques to achieve immortal life. 
She developed these ideas further in a private meeting with the Lennox 
seminar students and also discussed ways that emerging technologies are 
transforming the magazine and publishing industries.

12 Reality Hackers : Introductions : About this book
We were next visited by R.U. Sirius. Currently editor-in-chief of the 
transhumanist magazine h+, Sirius was widely known in the early 1990s 
as editor-in-chief of the popular “cyberpunk” magazine Mondo 2000. This 
publication was preceded by two other magazines that covered similar 
themes: High Frontiers and Reality Hackers. In fact, the title of this lecture 
series is an intentional tribute to his work. 
Additionally, Sirius (whose real name is Ken Goffman) has authored or 
co-authored 11 books, including Everybody Must Get Stoned, Cyberpunk 
Handbook, True Mutations and Design For Dying with psychedelic legend 
Timothy Leary. In 2000, Sirius ran a write-in campaign for president of 
the United States for the Revolution Party, an organization that offered a 
platform combining political left and libertarian themes.
In his public lecture “Hijack the Singularity or why the future must be 
post-scarcity or not at all,” Sirius argued that imminent technological 
advances will lead to massive economic disruption because our needs 
will be satisfied by technology rather than human labor. He called on the 
audience to view such developments as a wonderful opportunity to engage 
in more interesting and valuable creative activities. “Set yourself free,” he 
concluded. “Hijack the Singularity.” 
Freedom was also a key concern for our fourth guest: legendary game 
designer Richard Bartle. Currently a lecturer at Essex University, Bartle 
co-authored the world’s first virtual world as a college undergraduate 
in 1978. A former university lecturer in artificial intelligence, he is an 
influential writer on all aspects of virtual world design and development. 
As an independent consultant, he has worked with almost every major 
online gaming company in the U.K. and the U.S. over the past 20 years, 
transforming an undergraduate research project into a multi-billion dollar 
industry. His book Designing Virtual Worlds is widely viewed as a “tour de 
force of virtual world design.”
In his public lecture “Is the virtual too unrealistic? Crying over non-spilled 
milk,” Bartle took aim at the lack of “realisticness” in contemporary 
virtual worlds and called for the creation of open-ended virtual worlds 
that permit the same sort of unexpected, emergent behaviors that 
characterized the first text-based MUDs. He reminded the audience that, 
when he designed the first virtual world, his goal was to create a place 
where players could be and become who they really are. 
Last but not least, our fifth guest was Moscow-born author Ekaterina 
Sedia. Sedia’s third novel, The Alchemy of Stone, has been hailed as one 
the best science fiction novels of the previous decade. Her next work, The 
House of Discarded Dreams, is expected in July 2010. 
Sedia’s prose has been described as haunting and magical, and reviewers 
praise Sedia’s knack for “leaving readers to reach their own conclusions 
about the proper balance of tradition and progress and what it means to 
be alive.” She is an award-winning editor of the Paper Cities anthology; 
her next anthology, Running with the Pack, will be released in May 2010. 
In addition to writing, she teaches genetics, botany and plant ecology at a

state liberal arts college in New Jersey.
In a fascinating public lecture titled “genetic modification and copyright,” 
Sedia examined ways in which a legal framework designed to protect the 
intellectual property rights of creators is now being used by multinational 
corporations to patent sequences of DNA. Sedia noted that, though 
these laws were originally intended to promote creative and scientific 
expression, they have ended up doing the exact opposite. 
All five of these guest speakers were brought to campus with the generous 
support of the Martha, David, and Bagby Lennox Foundation. The ability 
to interact with these leading thinkers was a wonderful opportunity 
for Trinity students and professors, as well as for the many community 
members who attended the public lectures. 
Throughout the semester, students enrolled in the upper division 
Lennox seminar met three times a week for lecture, discussion, and other 
collaborative activities. The course was divided into three broad topic 
areas. First, we investigated the ways that emerging technologies intensify 
human connectedness and we considered some of the more troubling 
implications of a world in which the network can always find us. Second, 
we explored the transhuman movement, reviewed theories about the 
Technological Singularity, and identified examples of contemporary 
technology that are already changing what it means to be human. Third, 
influenced by Marshall McLuhan’s observation that new technologies 
function as prosthetic extensions of the human body, we looked into 
ways human beings are transforming and extending themselves via virtual 
worlds, biofeedback devices and other emerging interface technologies. 
The three major sections of this book (connected, transhuman and 
extended) correspond to these major topic areas. The book also includes 
student blog postings, related work from our guest speakers, and 
creative student projects (e.g., stories, photographs, performance art, 
documentaries, and machinima animations). Although most of the 
student projects are reprinted here, the limitations of print made it 
impossible to fully reproduce the video and audio works. To view those 
works, readers are encouraged to visit transmedia.trinity.edu
Students also worked together throughout the semester to promote 
and document the public lectures. Many of these leaflets and posters 
are reprinted in the appendix at the end of this book, along with the 
biographies of seminar participants.

WIKIPEDIA
“The hacker ethic”
Hacker ethic is the generic phrase which describes the values and 
philosophy that are standard in the hacker community. The early 
hacker culture and resulting philosophy originated at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT) in the 1950s and 1960s. The term ‘hacker 
ethic’ is attributed to journalist Steven Levy as described in his book 
titled Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, written in 1984. The 
guidelines of the hacker ethic make it easy to see how computers have 
evolved into the personal devices we know and rely upon today. The 
key points within this ethic are that of access, free information, and 
improvement to quality of life.
While some tenets of hacker ethic were described in other texts 
like Computer Lib/Dream Machines (1974) by Ted Nelson, Levy appears to 
have been the first to document and historicize both the philosophy and 
the founders of the philosophy.
Levy explains that MIT housed an early IBM 704 computer inside the 
Electronic Accounting Machinery (EAM) room in 1959. This room 
became the staging grounds for early hackers as MIT students from 
the Tech Model Railroad Club stole inside the EAM room after hours to 
attempt programming the 30 tonne, 9-foot-tall (2.7 m) computer.
The boys defined a hack as a project undertaken or a product built not 
solely to fulfil some constructive goal, but with some wild pleasure taken 
in mere involvement. 1
 The term “hack” arose from MIT lingo as the 
word had long been used to describe college pranks that MIT students 
would regularly devise. Hackers push programs beyond what they are 
designed to do. Levy notes that, at other universities, professors were 
making public proclamations that computers would never be able to beat 
a human being in chess. Hackers knew better. They would be the ones 
who would guide computers to greater heights than anyone expected. 2
The Hacker Ethic was a “new way of life, with a philosophy, an ethic and 
a dream”. However, the elements of the Hacker Ethic were not openly 
debated and discussed, rather they were accepted and silently agreed 
upon. 3
The hacker ethics
As Levy stated in the preface of Hackers: Heroes of the Computer 
Revolution,
4
 the general tenets or principles of hacker ethic include:
•	 Sharing
•	 Openness
•	 Decentralization
•	 Free access to computers
•	 World Improvement
0.9 You can and must understand computers 
now. Nelson, T. H., & Nelson, T. H. 
(1974). Computer lib. Chicago: Nelson.
Reality Hackers : Introductions : About this book 15
In addition to those principles listed above, Levy also described more 
specific hacker ethics and beliefs in chapter 2, The Hacker Ethic. 5
 The 
ethics he described in chapter 2 are quoted here.
Access to computers—and anything which might teach you something 
about the way the world works—should be unlimited and total. 
Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
Levy is recounting hackers’ abilities to learn and build upon pre-existing 
ideas and systems. He believes that access gives hackers the opportunity to 
take things apart, fix, or improve upon them and to learn and understand 
how they work. This gives them the knowledge to create new and even 
more interesting things (Levy, 1984:226)6
. Access aids the expansion of 
technology.
All information should be free.
Linking directly with access, information needs to be free for hackers to 
fix, improve, and reinvent systems. A free exchange of information allows 
for greater overall creativity.7
 In the hacker viewpoint, any system could 
benefit from an easy flow of information.8
Mistrust authority—promote decentralization.
The best way to promote the free exchange of information is to have an 
open system that presents no boundaries between a hacker and his quest 
for knowledge. Hackers believe that bureaucracies, whether corporate, 
government, or university, are flawed systems.9
Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria such as 
degrees, age, race, sex, or position.
Inherent in the hacker ethic is a meritocratic system where superficiality is 
disregarded in esteem of skill. Levy articulates that criteria such as age, sex, 
race, position, and qualification are deemed irrelevant within the hacker 
community. 10 Hacker skill is the ultimate determinant of acceptance. 
Such a code within the hacker community fosters the advance of hacking 
and software development.
Testament to the hacker ethic of equal opportunity, 11 L. Peter Deutsch, a 
twelve-year-old hacker, was accepted in the TX-0 community, though was 
not recognized by non-hacker graduate students.
You can create art and beauty on a computer.
Hackers deeply appreciate innovative techniques which allow programs to 
perform complicated tasks with few instructions. 12 A program’s code was 
considered to hold a beauty of its own, having been carefully composed 
and artfully arranged. 13 Learning to create programs which used the least 
amount of space almost became a game between the early hackers. 14

Computers can change your life for the better.
Hackers felt that computers had enriched their lives, given their lives 
focus, and made their lives adventurous. Hackers regarded computers 
as Aladdin’s lamps that they could control. 15They believed that everyone 
in society could benefit from experiencing such power and that if 
everyone could interact with computers in the way that hackers did, then 
the Hacker Ethic might spread through society and computers would 
improve the world. 16 The hacker succeeded in turning dreams of endless 
possibilities into realities. The hackers primary object was to teach society 
that “the world opened up by the computer was a limitless one” (Levy 
230:1984) 17
Sharing
According to Levy’s account, sharing was the norm and expected within 
the non-corporate hacker culture. The principle of sharing stemmed from 
the atmosphere and resources at MIT. During the early days of computers 
and programming, the hackers at MIT would develop a program and 
share it.
If the hack was particularly good, then the program might be posted on a 
board somewhere near one of the computers. Other programs that could 
be built upon and improved were saved to tapes and added to a drawer 
of programs—readily accessible to all the other hackers. At any time, a 
fellow hacker might reach into the drawer, pick out the program, and 
begin adding to it or “bumming” it to make it better (bumming refers to 
the process of making the code more concise so that more can be done in 
fewer instructions).
In the second generation of hackers, sharing was about sharing with the 
general public in addition to sharing with other hackers. A particular 
organization of hackers that was concerned with sharing computers with 
the general public was a group called Community Memory. This group 
of hackers and idealists put computers in public places for anyone to use. 
The first community computer was placed outside of Leopold’s Records 
in Berkeley, California
.
Another sharing of resources occurred when Bob Albrecht provided 
considerable resources for a non-profit organization called People’s 
Computer Company (PCC). PCC opened a computer center where 
anyone could use the computers there for fifty cents per hour.
This second generation’s sharing contributed to the battles of free and 
open software. In fact, when Bill Gates’ version of BASIC for the Altair 
was shared among the hacker community, Gates claimed to have lost a 
considerable sum of money because few users paid for the software. As 
a result, Gates wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists. 1819 This letter was 
published by several computer magazines and newsletters—most notably 
that of the Homebrew Computer Club where much of the sharing 
occurred.

About this book 17
Hands-on imperative
Many of the principles and tenets of Hacker Ethic contribute to a 
common goal—the Hands-On Imperative.20
Employing the Hands-On Imperative requires free access, open 
information, and the sharing of knowledge. To a true hacker, if the 
Hands-On Imperative is restricted, then the ends justify the means to 
make it unrestricted so that improvements can be made. 
When these principles are not present, hackers tend to work around 
them. For example, when the computers at MIT were protected either by 
physical locks or login programs, the hackers there systematically worked 
around them in order to have access to the machines. Hackers assumed a 
“wilful blindness” in the pursuit of perfection.21
It is important to note that this behavior was not malicious in nature—
the MIT hackers did not seek to harm the systems or their users (although 
occasional practical jokes were played using the computer systems). 
This deeply contrasts with the modern, media-encouraged image 
of hackers who crack secure systems in order to steal information or 
complete an act of cyber vandalism.
Community and collaboration
Throughout writings about hackers and their work processes, a common 
value of community and collaboration is present. 
For example, in Levy’s Hackers, each generation of hackers had 
geographically based communities where collaboration and sharing 
occurred. For the hackers at MIT, it was the labs where the computers 
were running. For the hardware hackers (second generation) and the game 
hackers (third generation) the geographic area was centered in Silicon 
Valley where the Homebrew Computer Club and the People’s Computer 
Company helped hackers network, collaborate, and share their work.
The concept of community and collaboration is still relevant today, 
although hackers are no longer limited to collaboration in geographic 
regions. Now collaboration takes place via the Internet. Eric S. 
Raymond identifies and explains this concept shift in The Cathedral and 
the Bazaar.
Before cheap Internet, there were geographically compact communities 
where the culture encouraged Weinberg’s egoless programming, and a 
developer could easily attract a lot of skilled kibitzers and co-developers. 
Bell Labs, the MIT AI and LCS labs, UC Berkeley—these became the 
home of innovations that are legendary and still potent.22
Raymond also notes that the success of Linux coincided with the wide 
availability of the World Wide Web. The value of community is still in 
high practice and use today.

Levy’s “true hackers”
Levy identifies several “true hackers” who significantly influenced the 
hacker ethic. Some well-known “true hackers” include:
•	 John McCarthy—Founder of the MIT Artificial 
Intelligence lab.
•	 Bill Gosper—A mathematician and hacker.
•	 Richard Greenblatt
•	 Richard Stallman—A programmer and political activist 
who is well-known for GNU, Emacs and the Free Software 
Movement.
Levy also identifies the “hardware hackers” (the “second generation”, 
mostly centered in Silicon Valley) and the “game hackers” (or the 
“third generation”). All three generations of hackers, according to Levy, 
embodied the principles of the hacker ethic.
Some of Levy’s “second-generation” hackers include:
•	 Steve Wozniak—One of two Steves that founded Apple, Inc.
•	 Bob Marsh—A designer of the Sol-20 computer.
•	 Steve Dompier—A homebrew member and hacker worked 
with the early Altair.
•	 Fred Moore—An activist and founder of the Homebrew 
Computer Club.
•	 Lee Felsenstein—A hardware hacker and cofounder 
of Community Memory and Homebrew. A designer of 
the Sol-20 computer.
Levy’s “third generation” practitioners of hacker ethic include:
•	 John Harris—One of the first programmers hired at On-Line 
Systems (later became Sierra Entertainment).
•	 Ken Williams—Along with wife Roberta, founded On-Line 
Systems after working at IBM.
New hacker ethic
Some have postulated that a “New Hacker Ethic” has evolved out of 
the older hacker ethic that originated at MIT. Steven Mizrach, who 
identifies himself with cyber-anthropologist studies, explored this idea of 
“New Hacker Ethic” in his essay titled “Is there a Hacker Ethic for 90s 
Hackers?”

Reality Hackers : Introductions : About this book 19
Identification of the “New Hacker Ethic” implies a radical shift in 
hacker ethic. While the nature of hacker activity has evolved due to the 
availability of new technologies (for example, the mainstreaming of the 
personal computer or the social connectivity of the Internet), the hacker 
ethics—particularly those of access, sharing, and community—remain the 
same.
Later in 2001, Finnish philosopher Pekka Himanen promoted the hacker 
ethic in opposition to the Protestant work ethic. In Himanen’s opinion 
the hacker ethic is more closely related to the virtue ethics found in the 
writings of Plato and of Aristotle.
For Himanen (who wrote The Hacker Ethic), Linus Torvalds (prologue), 
and Manuel Castells (epilogue), the hacker ethic centers around passion, 
hard work, creativity and joy in creating software. Both Himanen 
and Torvalds were inspired by the Sampo Finnish mythology. The 
Sampo, described in the Kalevala, was a magical artifact constructed by 
Ilmarinen, the blacksmith god, that brought good fortune to its holder; 
nobody knows exactly what it was supposed to be. The Sampo has been 
interpreted in many ways: a world pillar or world tree, a compass or 
astrolabe, a chest containing a treasure, a Byzantine coin die, a decorated 
Vendel period shield, a Christian relic, etc. In the Kalevala, compiler 
Lönnrot interpreted it to be a quern or mill of some sort that made flour, 
salt, and gold out of thin air.
Free software, open-source software, and hacker ethic
Free and open source software (often termed FOSS) is the descendant of 
the hacker ethics that Levy described. The hackers who hold true to the 
hacker ethics listed above—especially the Hands-On Imperative—are 
usually supporters of free software and/or open source software. This is 
because free and open source software allows hackers to access the code 
used to create the software to improve or reuse it. In effect the free and 
open source software movements embody all of the hacker ethics.

On January 17, 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered his farewell 
address to American citizens. This remarkable speech is often remembered for 
popularizing the term “military-industrial complex,” but it is equally notable 
for President Eisenhower’s observations about the tension between technology 
and democracy. In his closing words, Eisenhower warned citizens to remain 
vigilant to the increasing power of scientific and technological elites, stressing the 
importance of preserving democracy for “all generations to come.” 
Good evening, my fellow Americans.
First, I should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television 
networks for the opportunities they have given me over the years to bring 
reports and messages to our nation. My special thanks go to them for the 
opportunity of addressing you this evening.
Three days from now, after a half century in the service of our country, I 
shall lay down the responsibilities of office as, in traditional and solemn 
ceremony, the authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor. This 
evening, I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to 
share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.
Like every other—Like every other citizen, I wish the new President, and 
all who will labor with him, Godspeed. I pray that the coming years will be 
blessed with peace and prosperity for all.
Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential 
agreement on issues of great moment, the wise resolution of which will 
better shape the future of the nation. My own relations with the Congress, 
which began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of 
the Senate appointed me to West Point, have since ranged to the intimate 
during the war and immediate post-war period, and finally to the mutually 
interdependent during these past eight years. In this final relationship, the 
Congress and the Administration have, on most vital issues, cooperated 
well, to serve the nation good, rather than mere partisanship, and so have 
assured that the business of the nation should go forward. So, my official 
relationship with the Congress ends in a feeling—on my part—of gratitude 
that we have been able to do so much together.
We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed 
four major wars among great nations. Three of these involved our own 
country. Despite these holocausts, America is today the strongest, the most 
influential, and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud 
of this pre-eminence, we yet realize that America's leadership and prestige 
depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and 
military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world 
peace and human betterment.
Throughout America's adventure in free government, our basic purposes 
have been to keep the peace, to foster progress in human achievement, and

About this book 21
to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations. 
To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people. Any 
failure traceable to arrogance, or our lack of comprehension, or readiness to 
sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt, both at home and abroad.
Progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict 
now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbs our 
very beings. We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, 
ruthless in purpose, and insiduous [insidious] in method. Unhappily, the 
danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, 
there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of 
crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and 
without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with 
liberty the stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on 
our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.
Crises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or 
domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some 
spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to 
all current difficulties. A huge increase in newer elements of our defenses; 
development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture; a 
dramatic expansion in basic and applied research—these and many other 
possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only 
way to the road we wish to travel.
But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: 
the need to maintain balance in and among national programs, balance 
between the private and the public economy, balance between the cost 
and hoped for advantages, balance between the clearly necessary and the 
comfortably desirable, balance between our essential requirements as a 
nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual, balance 
between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future. 
Good judgment seeks balance and progress. Lack of it eventually finds 
imbalance and frustration. The record of many decades stands as proof 
that our people and their Government have, in the main, understood these 
truths and have responded to them well, in the face of threat and stress.
But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise. Of these, I mention two 
only.
A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms 
must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may 
be tempted to risk his own destruction. Our military organization today 
bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime, 
or, indeed, by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.
Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments 
industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, 
make swords as well. But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of 
national defense. We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments 
industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men 
and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually 
22 Reality Hackers : Introductions : About this book
spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United 
States cooperations—corporations.
Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large 
arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence—
economic, political, even spiritual—is felt in every city, every Statehouse, 
every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative 
need for this development. Yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave 
implications. Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved. So is the 
very structure of our society.
In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition 
of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power 
exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination 
endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for 
granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper 
meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with 
our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper 
together.
Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent 
decades. In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes 
more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is 
conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.
Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed 
by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same 
fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and 
scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. 
Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes 
virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there 
are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination 
of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the 
power of money is ever present—and is gravely to be regarded.
Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we 
must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could 
itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.
It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these 
and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic 
system—ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.
Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time. As 
we peer into society's future, we—you and I, and our government—must 
avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and 
convenience the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage 
the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of 
their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all 
generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.

About this book 23
During the long lane of the history yet to be written, America knows that 
this world of ours, ever growing smaller, must avoid becoming a community 
of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud confederation of mutual 
trust and respect. Such a confederation must be one of equals. The weakest 
must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we, 
protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength. That 
table, though scarred by many fast frustrations—past frustrations, cannot be 
abandoned for the certain agony of disarmament—of the battlefield.
Disarmament, with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuing 
imperative. Together we must learn how to compose differences, not with 
arms, but with intellect and decent purpose. Because this need is so sharp 
and apparent, I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this 
field with a definite sense of disappointment. As one who has witnessed the 
horror and the lingering sadness of war, as one who knows that another war 
could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully 
built over thousands of years, I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace 
is in sight.
Happily, I can say that war has been avoided. Steady progress toward our 
ultimate goal has been made. But so much remains to be done. As a private 
citizen, I shall never cease to do what little I can to help the world advance 
along that road.
So, in this, my last good night to you as your President, I thank you for 
the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and in 
peace. I trust in that—in that—in that service you find some things worthy. 
As for the rest of it, I know you will find ways to improve performance in 
the future.
You and I, my fellow citizens, need to be strong in our faith that all nations, 
under God, will reach the goal of peace with justice. May we be ever 
unswerving in devotion to principle, confident but humble with power, 
diligent in pursuit of the nation’s great goals.
To all the peoples of the world, I once more give expression to America's 
prayerful and continuing aspiration: We pray that peoples of all faiths, all 
races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those 
now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who 
yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings. Those who 
have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibility; that all who are 
insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; and that the sources—
scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made [to] disappear from 
the earth; and that in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live 
together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and 
love.
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen. I am proud to do 
so. I look forward to it.
Thank you, and good night.

southland tales
26 Reality Hackers : Connected : Southland Tales
Like I said in my introduction I deeply admire T.S. Eliot and have even 
taken the time to memorize as well as study several of his poems in 
my free time, so I had little difficulty recognizing "This is the way the 
world ends / Not with a bang but with a whimper" as a reference to 
Eliot's poem The Hollow Men right away. Although volumes could 
be written on the poem’s influence on modern culture as a whole, its 
specific connection with Southland Tales is that they both share the same 
message of a progressive cultural decay. 
Much like Eliot’s poem The Waste Land (written directly before The 
Hollow Men), this poem concerns a degradation of language and rituals, 
failings of both the Western man’s word and the Christian Word of God 
to save mankind both physically and spiritually. These hollow men are the 
effigies of this social decay; straw corpses damned to wander within a void 
of pure mind while permanently detached from any reality. They attempt 
to communicate with each other through "quiet and meaningless" 
whispers, groping together, enacting impotent and childish rituals so they 
can be heard by any other man or god. 
However, their efforts are ultimately futile for they have nothing to say 
that will offer them relief from their torment. They are helpless beings 
isolated from nature and exiled in a "cactus land" which is devoid of any 
spiritual presence. Ultimately, the fact that these hollow men will never be 
able to reconcile without meaningful spiritual connections has doomed 
them all to fade into obscurity with a whimper. 
Eliot believed that the emerging shallowness of Western culture was 
due to our inability to connect on a spiritual level with our fellow 
human beings and that this detachment from the world had led it face 
first into World War I, one of the bloodiest conflicts humanity had 
ever seen. Therefore Eliot rejected modern Western culture, seeing it as 
nothing more than a breeding ground for devastating social conflict and 
spiritual impotency. Instead, he looked toward the unspoiled Eastern 
philosophies as humanity’s only remaining savior in a cold and desolate 
world. 
The exact same type of social decay that has consumed the hollow men 
of the poem is rampant throughout the world of Southland Tales. It is a 
world without resonance; full of discordant images that refuse to come 
together in any meaningful way. This inability for the multimedia feed 
to generate a logical or consequential narrative of existence creates a 
world that is completely isolated and composed of entirely meaningless 
interactions between its inhabitants. 
Every character is a product of this isolation and culturally dead in 
their own way. Celebrities, soldiers, right wing politicians and Neo Marxists: everyone is an emblem of humanity at its most superficial level, 
having been digested into this grand social network of empty messages 
and regurgitated back onto a screen for the prying eyes of the world.

And despite the combined omnipresence of film streaming in from 
handheld video cameras, YouTube, 24-hour cable news channels, 
surveillance cameras, and the celebrity-tracking paparazzi, no one ever 
creates or does anything with this heap of broken images that truly 
connects humanity with their existence or even each other. These hollow 
men of the media are thereby doomed to wander within that same 
desolate cactus land that Eliot had condemned society in 1925. Indeed, 
they may have never even left it to begin with.
As for Robert Frost’s poem The Road Not Taken, I am not as great a 
follower of Frost as I am of Eliot but I do believe that it does connect with 
Southland Tales on the basis of political polarization. The poem itself is 
often interpreted as an affirmation of individualism and non-conformity 
as the speaker resolves to take a road less traveled by those who have 
passed through before. By forging his own path, the narrator has gained 
an invaluable and unique experience that is completely his own.
Throughout Southland Tales the main conflict is perpetuated by the two 
primary political parties: The Neo-Marxists and The Ultra Conservative 
Right. Each one is an embodiment of the two different political paths 
that an individual can follow and by choosing one affirm his own views 
on life. However, instead of moving on and gaining new experiences like 
the poem implies, each group has taken what they believe is “the road 
not taken” and as a result the two parties have turned against each other, 
terminating all social progression in the process. This is the great tragedy 
of a divided nation; the two party system meant to promote political 
compromise and unity is corrupted by petty differences and destroys 
everything that each side hopes to improve.

“The Revelation of Pilot Abilene”
The post is called The Revelation of Pilot Abilene because he is the 
narrator of the film, as St. John is the narrator of the Book of Revelation. 
Now the most popular view of the Book of Revelation is that it is a 
prediction of the end of the world and that various beasts and horsemen 
will come and destroy us. Yet, the book is an allegory of the constant trials 
and tribulations of the members of the Christian faith. John wrote in 
"vague" terms allowing the messages to connect with people throughout 
history. However near the end of the book it does give an idea of the end 
of times. Revelation is without a doubt, the most complicated book in the 
entire Bible.
A possible reason for this confusion is that St. John wrote in Greek. 
When transliterated into English, Αποκάλυψη, the Greek word for 
revelation, becomes apocalupsis. The words apocalypse and revelation are 
synonyms. Don't believe me? Look it up. They both mean "a revealing of 
information." So I throw the idea out there that the film does follow the 
Book of Revelation but to the point that the events here signify the end of 
the persecution of the US citizens.
Despite this differing view, the symbols of "the end" remain somewhat the 
same. In the view I take here, the Antichrist is not necessarily the bringer 
of the end of the world, but the leader of the persecution, and that person 
is Nana Mae Frost. She clearly is the leader of USIdent and the book and 
the film both say it was her brainchild. She leads the "persecution" of the 
citizens of the United States. 
Unfortunately the "whore of Babylon" is where this view and the 
mainstream Protestant view differ. Due to some error in translation, this 
character has been viewed as the whore of Babylon, as opposed to how the 
book actually describes her: the whore Babylon. She is not the whore OF, 
but in actuality is Babylon itself. In order to better explain this I've taken 
two quotes from Bishop Alexander Mileant’s analysis of the text.
First, he writes that: "the first to be subjected to punishment are those 
guilty people who had accepted the mark of the beast and the capital 
city of the antichristian empire ("Babylon")." He also explains that "the 
narrative regarding the fall of Babylon is given twice: at first in general 
terms at the end of the sixteenth chapter, and then in more detail in 
chapters 18-19. Babylon is depicted as a harlot sitting on the beast." 
From these I say that Babylon/the whore represents the empire of the 
antichrist or in our situation, the domain/tool of the antichrist (Nana 
Mae). Babylon is USIdent. It is the capital city of Nana Mae. It is where 
she resides throughout almost the entire movie. USIdent is the whore 
Babylon.
The two witnesses are clearly Dream and Dion. No question; the parallels 
are direct. Two people who preach are killed for their preaching. The 
four horses and riders of the apocalypse, often referred to as the four

horsemen, are also addressed in the film. In Revelation, the white horse 
is a representation of the good in the world throughout time, and the 
white horse in Southland Tales represents the period before the attacks on 
Texas. The red horse represents the period during and immediately after 
the bombing. The black horse correlates with the rule of USIdent, and the 
pale horse is the time during the story.
But who is Jesus in this film? Who represents the second coming of 
Christ? Since this is not the end of the world, there is no Christ figure. 
Since this is the end of the persecution, and not the end of times, Jesus 
has not returned and no one fulfills his role. This goes along with my view 
of Revelation. Only during the last several chapters does the book talk 
about the end of days and, while the vessels (the antichrist, Babylon, the 
prophets) are still there, they are the closest thing to their ideal archetypes 
as possible. In short, this only represents the end of the persecution of the 
American people. Most important, no one judges the people. Christ's role 
is to return to rule over and judge the world. That role is unfulfilled, so 
there is no Christ and it is not the end of the world. 
In short, Southland Tales parallels the non-end of the world part of the 
Book of Revelation. It is not the end of the world but merely the end of 
the USIdent regime.

“Thumbs for votes? Easier than kissing babies.”
Southland Tales! What a great film. One point of interest in the film is 
the small bit where they feature a bag of thumbs, which is never properly 
explained in the film. In the graphic novel, however, one can find a larger 
explanation of the thumbs—which still doesn’t fully make sense to me. 
The idea is that in the future (the tangent future or the “now” but “there”) 
thumb prints are used for identification in voting. This process seems 
simple enough; the idea of a free-floating voter isn’t exactly new, but they 
complicate things when they say that each thumb can vote hundreds of 
times in different areas. 
I would’ve thought that only one vote accompanied each person in the 
system no matter where they were. I suppose the technology conveyed 
only grabs information for that one sector? Or perhaps I don’t fully 
understand their voting process. Either way, this definitely reminds me of 
the movie Gangs of New York (and, maybe, some history class where we 
talked about Boss Tweed) where the Irish used all the Irish people to win 
an election for their own man. Each person voted multiple times, tricking 
the government by shaving off their hair right after they had voted so that 
they could vote again. Pretty silly, really... how could they ever catch them 
voting multiple times anyway? 
In Southland Tales the bag full of thumbs fits in with the film’s chaos and 
government vs. neo-Marxist theme. Chaos is evident in the fact that even 
voting isn’t secure anymore; identity and privacy are long gone. The neo Marxists use the thumbs to further their own agenda, and add to more of 
the conflict in the novel/movie. The thumbs are supposed to be used to 
vote for Proposition 69, the limiting of USIdent’s power and the central 
idea that spurred the Marxist movement.

“Digits for Democracy”
The bag full of thumbs is one of the most straight forward parts of the 
film and is directly related to the election and the use of thumbprints 
as identification for USIdent, the overarching government control on 
cyberspace. The idea implied by the Neo-Marxists is that by mailing 
thumbs to different voting districts they will be able to use that person’s 
identity to cast multiple votes thus swaying the outcome of the election.
The process described is not new to the voting process in many ways. 
Two of the most prominent ideas are the use of ballet stuffing and the use 
of thumbs in voting. In regards to ballot stuffing, this was historically 
accomplished by physically placing more than one ballot into the vote 
box in order to influence the vote in one way or the other. As voting 
technology increased this became more difficult and required a way 
to beat the technology. With USIDENT in Southland Tales using 
thumbprints to track voting, the Neo-Marxists are attempting to cheat 
the systems by mailing thumbs to different voting districts. This is ballot 
stuffing for the new technological era.
The use of thumbs in voting ironically comes from the “bad guys” 
according to Southland Tales. In the 2005 Iraq elections voters dipped 
their thumb in indelible ink after voting to signify that they had voted 
and therefore could not vote again. The scanning of the thumbprint 
is once again simply a more high tech version of a historical voting 
procedure.
Why are the Neo-Marxists going through all the trouble and sacrificing 
their thumbs? Well it is all about getting a YES vote on Proposition 69. 
By implementing the proposition, government control would be severely 
limited. 
In November 2004, California passed Proposition 69: The DNA 
Fingerprint Unsolved Crime and Innocence Protection Act. This is 
probably not a coincidence. This legislation gave law enforcement agencies 
and other State officials the ability to collect DNA samples from felons 
and other criminals. 
California now has one of the largest DNA databases in the world. This is 
surprisingly similar to California in the world of Southland Tales.

“USIdent in Southland Tales: TIA on Steroids.”
Southland Tales is an ‘iceberg’ type of film. At face value, it seems like a 
weird, nonsensical concept jabbing at the government and social politics - 
but there is so much underlying information and big clues as to how this 
film is meant to be interpreted. It’s one of those films you have to watch 
a couple times to even begin to understand the meaning, much less the 
hidden messages. 
Yes, there are strong references to the Book of Revelation and 
sociopolitical undertones to even the simplest of concepts throughout the 
film (like extortion and pornography and ripping ATM machines out of 
buildings) - but I could talk about that for ages. Among the many societal 
parallels in the movie to real life, one of the biggest correlations would 
be between Southland’s USIdent program and the Total Information 
Awareness (TIA) program that has since been discontinued by the US 
government.
TIA was a government-run and owned program that proactively 
functioned for national security and against terrorism in the United 
States. Established in the early 2000s, this program endured vast 
amounts of public criticism for the severe privacy breach and threat to 
personal security in the name of full governmental control. Out of fear 
that this would spiral downwards into a completely unconstitutional 
seizure of privacy and mass surveillance, the Information Awareness 
Office was defunded by the government thus putting a halt to the Total 
Information Awareness chaos. The proposed technologies were too 
invasive and posed as a personal threat to Americans. 
It seems absolutely ridiculous that our US Government would go as far as 
some completely corrupt nations and attempt to wipe out every last bit of 
privacy among the relatively innocent and unassuming citizens in order to 
have a better (but not much steadier) grip on terrorism. Ridiculous, yes. 
But in Southland Tales, this concept is made a reality.
USIdent is a government-funded program run by Senator Bobby Frost’s 
wide, Nana Mae Frost. With its governmental affiliations, USIdent is 
a sick and twisted mode of full population control. This program is 
a mass surveillance of the American people meant for keeping order, 
preventing crime and terrorism, and—what is deceivingly made to be 
the main priority—aid in identification. Cameras are placed all over, in 
even the most random of places. Chaos breaks out sporadically around 
the cities. Every single move that anybody makes is watched—even in 
the bathroom. This is the end of privacy, and the beginning of social and 
societal warfare.
The theme of governmental control is prevalent in the film, as it plays 
a pawn in the mechanics of the complex story as a whole. The corrupt 
government ultimately catalyzes the end of the world; it puts Americans 
against one another, it creates a social divide, it causes mass panic and 
revolt. There is finally a point of having too much power, and that is

1.10 Total Information Awareness (TIA). 
TIA is a surveillance regime envisioned 
by the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) as a response to the 
terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001. Although TIA funding was officially 
terminated in 2004, core elements of the 
plan were shifted to other agencies. 
when the world as they knew it bottoms out. USIdent cleverly mirrors 
what may have been a further-developed TIA. Even more jarring is how 
the ramifications are portrayed. I don’t fully agree that’s how society 
would have unfolded, and of course Southland Tales is simply an artsy, 
philosophical dramatization - but I certainly think that our country would 
have lost its identity and its promise beyond any hope.
All in all, this film was mind-blowing in the good way and in the bad 
way. The most amazing part is the beach scene. And the Justin Timberlake 
intermission.

“I got soul but I’m not a soldier: Richard Kelly’s Southland Tales”
Southland Tales (2007) is the second film by Richard Kelly, whose 
previous work was the cult hit Donnie Darko (2001). Southland Tales 
shares with its predecessor a general air of apocalyptic unease, and a plot 
that circles around the idea of time travel. In both films, “time is out 
of joint”; linear, progressive temporality has somehow come undone. 1
But Southland Tales is a much more wide-ranging and ambitious movie 
than Donnie Darko; and it features a large ensemble cast, instead of 
being focused upon a single protagonist. The eponymous hero of Donnie 
Darko sacrifices himself in order to save the world. By accepting his own 
death, he abolishes an alternative timeline in which his teenage alienation 
redounds into disaster for everyone around him. Donnie’s sacrifice 
offers us what Gilles Deleuze describes as the cinema’s greatest gift: the 
restoration of our “belief in this world” (1989, 188). Southland Tales, 
however, is set entirely within a catastrophic alternative timeline. There 
is no way back to suburban normalcy. The End Times are near, as the 
film makes clear with its frequent quotes from the Book of Revelation. 
And the drama of sacrifice and redemption in Southland Tales points, not 
towards a restoration of “this world,” but towards its nihilistic purgation 
and transcendence. We are swept headlong, through the raptures of media 
immersion, into an entropic terminal state – and perhaps also beyond it, 
out the other side. 
Southland Tales begins with home video footage of a family Independence 
Day celebration. The date is July 4, 2005. The footage, filled with random 
cuts and amateurish swish pans, shows folks, both old and young, just 
enjoying themselves. But then there’s a roar and a flash, followed by 
a rumbling and a jittering and the sight of a mushroom cloud in the 
distance. Terrorists have detonated two atomic bombs in Texas. This is 
the bifurcation point, the rupture in continuity, the moment when the 
“straight line” of time becomes a “labyrinth” (Deleuze 1989, 131). We 
have left the world we know, and entered an alternative timeline: one that 
diverges irreparably from our own. The homeliness of the film’s opening 
moments will never return. History has been derailed – it has gone mad – 
and there is no putting it back on track. Cut to computer graphics, voice over narration, and the hallucinatory mediascape of Southland Tales.
The bulk of the movie takes place in Southern California (the 
“Southland”), three years after this initial attack, in the days leading up to 
the frenzied Independence Day celebration of July 4, 2008. The “war on 
terror” has blossomed into a full-fledged World War III. American troops 
are fighting, not just in Iraq and Afghanistan, but in Syria, Iran, and 
North Korea as well. The draft has been reinstated; martial law has been 
declared in some areas. Throughout the United States, police surveillance 
is ubiquitous, and there is no interstate travel without a visa. All Internet 
communication is monitored by a government spy facility called US IDent. The police are authorized to shoot on sight anyone suspected 
of terrorism. The Republican Party is firmly in control of the country. 
Electoral politics has been reduced to its essence: televison advertising. 
International oil supplies have been cut off, and the sinister Treer 
[1] Gilles Deleuze uses this phrase 
from Hamlet to describe the Kantian 
revolution in philosophy, as a result 
of which time is freed from its 
classical subordination to movement 
(Deleuze 1984, vii). This liberation 
of time, the unveiling of “time 
itself, ‘a little time in its pure 
state’ ” (1989, 17), is the key to 
what Deleuze calls the cinematic 
time-image, in which “we enter into 
temporality as a state of permanent 
crisis” (112). Both Donnie Darko and 
Southland Tales are concerned with 
such a sense of temporality in crisis, 
or temporality as crisis; though I 
want to suggest that the latter film 
moves ‘beyond’ the Deleuzian time image in order to articulate a new 
regime of images and sounds, and a new 
mode of temporality.

corporation holds a monopoly on America’s alternative energy resources. 
The only opposition to this state of affairs comes from a comically inept, 
confused, and internally fragmented “neo-Marxist” underground. 
Southland Tales is, evidently, deeply concerned with the post-9/11 
American security state. The conceit of an alternative timeline allows 
Kelly to explore, in exacerbated and hyperbolic fashion, our actual 
current condition of ubiquitous surveillance, restricted civil liberties, and 
permanent warfare. This regime of control was instituted by the second 
Bush administration, in the wake of the World Trade Center attacks; it 
largely remains in effect today. 2 Southland Tales could be described, to a 
certain extent, as a dark satire in the tradition of Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove. 
It pushes the logic of the security state to absurdist extremes. In the world 
of the film, there is no right to privacy, and almost no private space. 
Phonecalls are routinely wiretapped, recorded, and traced. All public 
activity is captured on video; even the toilets are watched by surveillance 
cameras. A recurrent image in the film shows the creepy Homeland 
Security czar Nana Mae Frost (played by Miranda Richardson, channeling 
Angela Lansbury’s performance in The Manchurian Candidate), sitting 
in her command chair at US-IDent headquarters, monitoring the video 
feeds on multiple screens that cover a large curving wall in front of her. 
In the world of Southland Tales, if you step out of line, or arouse distrust, 
you are likely to have your home invaded by an armed and masked SWAT 
team, or to be picked off on the beach by a government sniper. But most 
people remain oblivious to all these intrusions; they continue to drink, 
party, and otherwise enjoy themselves on the Venice Beach boardwalk, 
just as if nothing were amiss.
However, despite these currents of satire, Southland Tales is finally best 
described as a science fiction film. Its overall tone is earnest and urgent, 
even visionary – more than it is sarcastic or comic. Southland Tales, like 
most science fiction, is not about literally predicting the future. Rather, 
it is about capturing and depicting the latent futurity that already haunts 
us in the present. At one point in the film, the porn actress Krysta Now 
(Sarah Michelle Gellar) excitedly remarks that “scientists are saying the 
future is going to be far more futuristic than they originally predicted.” 
The reason this comment is ludicrous is that “futuristic” is not an ob jective category, but an anticipatory inflection of the present. Southland 
Tales is indeed futuristic, in that it shows us an otherness, an elsewhere 
and elsewhen, that is inextricably woven into the texture of the here 
and now. We usually think of hauntings as traces from the past; but the 
future also haunts us with its hints of hope and danger, and its promises 
or threats of transformation. Especially in times of great social and 
technological change, we feel the imminence of the future in the form 
of gaps and leaps in temporal progression, and shifts in the horizon of 
what is thinkable. Of course it is impossible to know what changes the 
future will bring; but the signs of this impossibility – the intimations of 
instability, the shifts of perspective, and the incipient breaks in continuity 
– are themselves altogether real. They are part of the conjuncture, part of 
what shapes the present. If the past persists in the present, then futurity 
insists in the present, defamiliarizing what we take for granted. Science 
fiction highlights this sense of futurity, making it visible and audible.

President on promises to reverse Bush 
administration policies, and although 
he has curbed some of its worse 
excesses, at this writing (2009) the 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continue, 
surveillance remains widespread, and 
the White House still endorses the use 
of preventive detention without trial.

Southland Tales is an ironically cinematic remediation of the post-cinematic 
mediasphere that we actually live in. The film’s alternative timeline is 
defined precisely by its divergence from the world we know. 3
Southland Tales is more about what I am calling the post-cinematic media 
regime in general, than it is about the national security apparatus in 
particular. Terrorism and the “war on terror” are parts of this new media 
regime, but they are not its basis, nor even its primary focus. At most, 
they are catalysts: they intensify and speed up the emergence of new media 
forms, and of their corresponding new modes of subjectivity. Surveillance 
is only one aspect of a broader process; Nana Mae Frost is not the only 
one monitoring multiple screens, and trying to pay attention all at once 
to a plethora of media feeds. In fact, all of the characters in the film are 
doing this, more or less; and so are most of us in the audience. Southland 
Tales surveys and maps – and mirrors back to us in fictive form – the 
excessive, overgrown post-cinematic mediasphere. The film bathes us in 
an incessant flow of images and sounds; it foregrounds the multimedia 
feed that we take so much for granted, and ponders what it feels like 
to live our lives within it. Video surveillance cameras are ubiquitous, 
of course, in the world of the film as well as well as in the world that 
we inhabit; but so are many other sorts of recording, broadcasting, and 
communications devices. Social space is filled to bursting with handheld 
videocams, mobile phones, portable screens, 24-hour cable news chan nels, YouTube clips, MySpace pages, automated response systems, and 
celebrity-tracking papparazzi. Images and sounds are continually being 
looped for endless replay, or composited together into new configurations. 
In Southland Tales, traditionally ‘cinematic’ sequences are intermixed with 
a sensory-overload barrage of lo-fi video footage, Internet and cable-TV 
news feeds, commercials, and simulated CGI environments. These often 
appear in windows within windows, so that the movie screen itself comes 
to resemble a video or computer screen. 
Despite the emphasis upon surveillance and security, the mediascape 
explored by Southland Tales is not in the least bit hidden or secretive. It is 
rather a vast, open performance space, carnivalesque, participatory, and 
overtly self-reflexive. Not only do we see multiple, heterogeneous screens 
within the movie screen; we also see the characters in the movie appearing 
on these screens, creating content for them, and watching them – often 
all at the same time. If the government isn’t recording your actions with 
hidden cameras, then perhaps someone else is, for purposes of blackmail. 
But more likely, you are making and distributing videos of yourself, in a 
quest for publicity and profit. In any case, your mediated image is what 
defines you. If you aren’t already an actor or a celebrity – as most of the 
characters in Southland Tales are – then you probably have a business 
plan to become one. Every character in the movie seems to be frantically 
engaged in exhibitionistic display, outlandish performance, and ardent 
networking for the purpose of self-promotion. The world of Southland 
Tales has become what Jamais Cascio, inverting Foucault, calls the 
Participatory Panopticon: “this constant surveillance is done by the citizens 
themselves, and is done by choice. It’s not imposed on us by a malevolent 
bureaucracy or faceless corporations. The participatory panopticon will be 
the emergent result of myriad independent rational decisions, a bottom 1.14 Post-cinematic media regime. Film

[3] In other words, science fiction 
is a kind of “realism”: but it is a 
realism of what Deleuze calls the 
virtual, rather than one of the 
actual here and now. For Deleuze, 
“the virtual is fully real” on its 
own account; but it is a special 
sort of reality, “real without being 
actual, ideal without being abstract, 
and symbolic without being fictional” 
(1994, 208). I discuss science 
fiction as a realism of the virtual, 
which “addresses events in their 
potentiality,” in my book Connected
(Shaviro 2003, xi and passim).

up version of the constantly watched society” (Cascio 2005). The reign 
of universal transparency, with its incessant circulation of sounds and 
images, and its “participatory” media ecology in which everyone keeps 
tabs on everyone else, does not need to be imposed from above. Rather, 
in the post-cinematic media regime, it “emerges,” or “self-organizes,” 
spontaneously from below. The greatest success of what Michel Foucault 
calls governmentality comes about, not when a certain type of behavior is 
forcibly imposed upon people, but when people can be “incentivized” to 
impose this behavior willingly upon one another, and upon themselves. 
Southland Tales does not exempt itself from the frenzied media economy 
that it depicts. The movie is itself a post-cinematic, transmedia object. 
Tom Abba describes it as an “extended narrative,” in which the story 
is spread across several media (Abba 2009, 60). Most notably, Richard 
Kelly published a three-part comic book, or graphic novel, that gives the 
movie’s premises and backstory (Kelly and Weldele 2007). Many of the 
plot twists, convolutions, and digressions in South-land Tales can only 
be understand by reading the comic first. This is why the movie’s titles 
divide it into Parts IV, V, and VI; Parts I, II, and III are found in the 
comic. In addition, when Southland Tales was first released, a number 
of the film’s (fictional) characters had websites on MySpace; the movie’s 
(equally fictional) Treer Corporation had its own website as well. There 
was also a certain amount of spillover between the characters in the 
movie, and the pop culture celebrities who played them. Sarah Michelle 
Gellar actually recorded, under her own name, the song “Teen Horniness 
Is Not A Crime” – which in the film is written and performed (with an 
accompanying music video) by her character Krysta Now. The song is 
included on the movie’s soundtrack album, and is available for download 
from the iTunes Music Store. 
Of course, this sort of spread among multiple platforms is not unique to 
Southland Tales. It is an increasingly common media strategy today. As 
Richard Grusin notes, film today is turning into a distributed medium: 
“the film is not confined to the form of its theatrical exhibition but is 
distributed across other media as well.” For instance, “the production, 
design, and distribution of DVD versions of feature films are part of the 
original contractual (and thus artistic) intention of these films.” Grusin 
adds that this sort of remediation “marks a fundamental change in the 
aesthetic status of the cinematic artifact” (Grusin 2007). His point is 
that the aesthetic experience of a film today may reside just as much in 
watching the DVD extras, or in exploring the associated websites, as it 
does in watching the film itself. For that matter, the media experience 
may well reside in children’s playing with toys that are modeled after 
figures from an animated film, and given away as part of a cross-platform 
promotional strategy. The aesthetics of distributed media cannot be 
separated from their marketing. For its part, Southland Tales not only 
supplements itself with a variety of intertextual materials in other media, 
but also folds the practice of multimedia distribution and dispersion into 
the narrative of the film itself. Most notably, Krysta Now seeks to leverage 
her semi-celebrity as a porn starlet not only by recording songs and 
making a music video, but also by starring in her own talk-show-cum reality-television series, and by selling her own energy drink. 
[4] Ironically, very few people have 
seen Southland Tales on the big 
screen; in its limited release to 
movie theaters, it was a calamitous 
flop. The film disappointed fans of 
Donnie Darko, because it was so 
oblique and disjointed narratively, 
and because it was impossible to 
“identify” with any of the characters 
in the way that so many viewers did 
with Darko’s eponymous protagonist. 
As I will argue below, Southland 
Tales is no less empathetic to its 
characters than Donnie Darko is; 
but this empathy no longer takes 
the form of traditional cinematic 
“identification.” Links to other 
reviews of the film can be found at 
www.mrqe.com/movies/m100064789?s=1. 
I can only hope that Southland Tales 
will find a new audience, thanks to 
its recent DVD and Blu-Ray releases.

What this means is that, although Southland Tales is very much a movie, 
it is also profoundly post-cinematic in both form and content. I say that 
it remains a movie, in the sense that it is big and spectacular, and that it 
was clearly intended to be viewed in a movie theater, on an enormous 
screen.4
 However, its audiovisual flow is entirely post-cinematic, and 
of a piece with the video-based and digital media that play such a role 
within it. The compositional logic of Southland Tales is paratactic and 
additive, having little to do with conventional film syntax. The film is 
filled with inserts; it overlays, juxtaposes, and restlessly moves between 
multiple images and sound sources. But it does not provide us with any 
hierarchical organization of all these elements. Many of the film’s most 
arresting images just pop up, without any discernible motivation or point 
of view. For instance, around the five-minute mark, shortly after a title 
reading “Los Angeles,” there is a shot of a G. I. Joe doll, advancing on 
knees and elbows along a wet sidewalk, then firing a rifle. It is nighttime. 
We see the toy in sharp focus and in close-up, while behind it the full 
extent of the boulevard, lined by palm trees, stretches out-of-focus into 
the deep background. The sounds emitted by the toy are accompanied, on 
the soundtrack, by Moby’s soothing ambient music, and by a voiceover 
newscast reporting that celebrity-turned-soldier Pilot Abilene (Justin 
Timberlake) has been wounded in Fallujah by friendly fire. The film never 
returns to this toy figure; it has no function in the narrative. Of course, 
the film is filled with references to soldiers, and to wounded veterans like 
Pilot Abilene; but is that enough to motivate the appearance of the toy? 
The image of G. I. Joe is just there. It grabs our attention because it is 
anomalous and unexpected; it is evocative in a way that we cannot quite 
pin down. The film bequeaths us this moment, and then moves on to 
something else. G. I. Joe is just one figure in the movie’s ceaseless flow. 5
[5]The film critics Richard T. 
Jameson and Kathleen Murphy include 
the shot of G. I. Joe in their list 
of “favorite moments” from the 
movies of 2007: <http://movies.msn.

It is worth noting that much of 
the recent theoretical discussion 
of cinephilia has been concerned 
with “the cinephiliac moment”: 
that is to say, with the way that 
cinephiles tend to focus upon, 
and even obsessively fetishize, 
particular shots, instants, or 
details of a film, which they 
extract and isolate from the film as 
a whole (Keathley 2006, 29-53). But 
Southland Tales is edited in such 
a way that each of its moments is, 
as it were, already thus extracted 
and isolated for cinephiliac 
delectation. Kelly simultaneously 
overloads us with “information,” 
and disperses that information in 
such a way that we cannot bring it 
together, and grasp it as a whole.

In regards to the pages assigned to us, my favorite idea came from this 
quote:
“The disciplinary archives constitute a cohesive, totalizing 
representation of society and of every individual within it. Each 
person has an eerie double, in the form of a police file dedicated 
specifically to him or her. The disciplinary subject is thus what 
Foucault calls “a strange empirico-transcendental doublet” (1970, 
p. 318).... These two sides correspond point by point. Yet they 
remain incommensurable. The map is not the territory. The 
dossier is not the prisoner.”
Shaviro continues on to say that this isn’t how new control society works 
anymore, but I still was fascinated by the idea and began to think of ways 
that this functions in our life. Obviously none of us as students have a 
prison dossier, but what empirico-transcendental doublets operate in our 
lives? Our resumes are our life’s “worthiness” in summary. Our transcripts 
are who we are as students. That piece of paper (or that screen on the 
computer) is us as a student. Summed up in just one screen shot. Four 
years of college could be explained in just one screen shot. 
Even less academic forms are familiar to us. Facebook pages are an 
example of a “cohesive, totalizing representation ...of [an] individual.” 
Could we go to a stranger’s Facebook page and find out entirely about 
them? Maybe not entirely, but we could gather a great deal about them 
just from one place.
Based on this quote and these ideas, I suppose my question or perhaps 
request to Shaviro would be further explain how society has shifted from 
this form of control to one that uses constant surveillance. He says:
“There may well be more surveillance than ever, but this 
surveillance no longer leads to an archive of “permanent 
documentation” that doubles actual existence. Instead the

results of surveillance are immediately fed back into the system. 
Surveillance records do not merely record past behavior, nor do 
they provide typological models to be applied to future behavior. 
Rather, the accumulated data works to manipulate behavior 
directly, in real time, in the immediate present. There is no longer 
any duality between data, on one hand, and bodies to which 
those data would refer, on the other... Surveillance records are no 
longer about anyone or anything. They are performative instead of 
constative; it is not what they say that matters, but what they do. 
It is precisely, and exclusively, under such conditions that we say 
everything in the world is information.”
I kind of get that. But not really. How does this accumulated data 
manipulate behavior directly? I suppose he could be referring to a point 
he makes later on that surveillance cameras aren’t there to capture crimes 
on camera— they’re there to prevent them from ever happening. That 
could be what Shaviro means by “manipulating behavior directly” but I’m 
not sure. Whatever his point is, I’d like to hear it expanded on because I 
think it’s really interesting.
Later in the book, Shaviro discusses the Singularity (pp. 120-128). He 
quotes Kurzweil and talks about AI, and I understand this section even 
less than the assigned one and yet I still enjoyed reading it. He talked 
about these little nanobots called foglets (which I kept reading as froglets, 
so I was imagining little bitty robotic tadpoles) that someday maybe 
we’ll be able to download our brains into and somehow they’ll make us 
whatever food we’ll want.... something, something. I re-read it a couple 
times, still loved it, but still extremely confused.
I feel like that’s the key to this book. Loving the confusion.

I found all of Shaviro’s work to be interesting in its own right and to be 
well explained. I am however fascinated by his idea of, to put it simply, 
technology taking over the world. Now Shaviro elaborates and is much 
more elegant and thorough than I am, but in essence the majority of his 
writing culminates with technology and those who wind up controlling it 
ruling the world and the known universe. 
As Shaviro puts it, “It [the network] does not need to put us under 
surveillance, we belong to it, we exist for it already.” I have to admit, when 
I think about it, I completely agree. 
As technology becomes more and more powerful, it is constantly 
generating new ways for individuals to control other individuals 
and making the old ones more efficient. Technology already allows 
for government officials to keep tabs on the general populace and as 
technology improves it is only going to become more extensive, but are 
we really complaining about it? 
Our world has become so technology friendly that much of this 
monitoring goes unnoticed or ignored because it has become common 
place. We are accepting these new technologies that will allow for our 
eventual control because they make our life easier.

“What is mind? No matter.”
A few sections of Shaviro’s book that I found particularly interesting were 
entitled “What is Mind? No Matter” and “What is Matter? Never Mind.” 
Both of these sections discuss the movie The Matrix and delve into our 
perceptions of simulations and what is actually real. 
Cyberspace itself consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, 
but no bodies actually live there. As Internet users we are virtually free to 
go anywhere we choose, our physical body remains in place, but we can 
take our minds to worlds of complete simulation. 
Our minds are set free in cyberspace. However, because there are so many 
simulations present in society today it is sometimes hard for us to trust 
appearances. As we have seen represented in the movie Gamer, games like 
Second Life are a way for a person to live an alternate life, and in no way 
does a person’s avatar have to resemble them. Deception is alive and well 
in cyberspace and it is extremely hard to trust people while surfing the 
World Wide Web. 
As we become a society more and more ingrained in the cyber-world 
it appears that simulation will continue to advance. If and when the 
Singularity occurs, AI will be so advanced that it would surpass the level 
of simulation. No longer will these machines simulate life, but they will 
exist as one within society itself, and this is where The Matrix comes in to 
play. 
In The Matrix, the simulated world is so real that our minds can’t help 
but be convinced that it is real. While our bodies rest in some primordial 
ooze our minds are taken to a world where, as Neo learns, anything is 
possible. The virtual world is so complete; it is a prison for the mind. 
The problem with this is that we are in prison, but we do not realize that 
we are. Is surveillance reaching a point today where we could consider it 
a prison? Like in the Panopticon, we could be monitored at any moment. 
With so many cameras, both private and public, watching 24 hours a day 
it seems impossible to always know when big brother is monitoring us.
Lastly, I also enjoyed the sections “Codes for the Cataclysm” and “Rhythm 
Warfare.” In these sections Shaviro discusses the possibility of mega 
corporations monopolizing the flow of information. Over the summer I 
worked for a company called Info USA which sells an enormous database 
of information from geo-coded data to the value of your house. I hate to 
say it, but I sold information to the government. It will be interesting to 
see where TIA goes in the next few years. 
44 Reality Hackers : Connected : Shaviro
In Connected, Shaviro speaks of surveillance and its increasing reliance 
on the power of data. Interestingly enough, does this infer that 
the world will become full of nothing but data? It seems from the 
reading that surveillance in every form is leading the way for constant 
observation. The difference between surveillance and observation, to me, 
can be seen in the motives involved. Surveillance seems to elicit a “need” 
for control or power; there is always something to be collected from 
surveillance, to be archived and put into forms that cross-reference one 
another for purposes of monitoring/implementing control. 
Observation, on the other hand, seems to serve the purpose of data-izing 
our life, which I believe Shaviro states when he speaks of Bill Gates’ house 
and the Microsoft House of the Future. But by putting our lives into 
data, transforming them into process thereof, and using them for the 
sole intentions of observation (having computers look into eyes, measure 
body temperature, all for the purpose to change the AC in your house), 
when can we draw a line between the surveillance and observation? To 
succinctly summarize, our lives are being transformed into data, some of 
the data is collected for surveillance (need to inflict control) and other 
data is collected from observation (to achieve efficient streamlined lives). 
In our lifetimes, will we see a shift from surveillance to observation or 
vice-versa? With the emerging technologies being created by Google and 
Microsoft’s House of the Future (but I don’t think this ever really took 
off?) that promise to observe our lives, will this information eventually be 
used to exercise control? With that being stated, will this control be used 
in a manner to establish overarching power? Or will it control our lives 
in a way that we all become moral according to the morality of the data 
machine, which would eliminate the need for overarching control because 
we are all connected from the data source which regulates our lives? 
Maybe I missed the point here, but the collection of information and data 
is a scary thought; many people might put power in the wrong hands, 
which might lead to constant surveillance by one central authority. But 
by the same token, surveillance is not a one-way model. So when does 
surveillance from central authority become surpassed in “power” by the 
surveillance of a mass? For example, consider the Vietnam War. Was 
this not the first televised war—leading to the mass surveillance which far 
overpowered the surveillance from authorities? 
I know I asked many questions, but they all boil down to the power 
of surveillance and data, and who controls what. Data is collected by 
the prison system, but data is also collected from prisoners about the 
prison system itself. Do upheavals in society occur when the powers of 
surveillance shift? And being a History major, I’m all about the status 
quo; so I also wonder how surveillance (when its power is dynamic) 
affects the status quo of those being surveyed and what happens when the 
surveyed collect enough data themselves of the surveyors. In the future, 
will data equal power?

“To roll it toward some overwhelming question.”
Having read some of Steven Shaviro's work I must say that I am 
looking forward to his lecture on Thursday. Specifically, it was Shaviro’s 
dissertation on the potential development of AI and the Technological 
Singularity that piqued my interest; this manifestation of humanity’s 
future self. 
Indeed there seems to be an almost endless torrent of differing outlooks 
on what form a virtual mind would eventually take and its impact on 
humanity as a species. From hive minds to omnipotent observer-deities, 
it seems that many people believe in the transcendental nature of such 
technologies to liberate the mind from its fleshy limitations and transform 
it into an entity of pure thought. 
Shaviro, however, takes a much more realistic approach to the argument 
by addressing the limited economic and political factors of technology as 
well as the limitations of the mind itself. He maintains that, even if strong 
AI is possible, these virtual minds will be essentially contingent entities 
with their own set of interests. Any differences between human minds 
and their virtual counterparts will be purely political or cultural. Shaviro 
affirms that all post-Singularity technology will be integrated into the 
texture of everyday life, bettering it but ultimately leaving it the same. 
For the most part I agree with Shaviro’s critique of those who believe in 
the ‘metaphysical’ nature of the Technological Singularity. Humanity will 
always be restricted by both its social and physical limitations and post Singularity technologies will be of no exception. 
However, I do not think that we can rule anything out just yet. Of 
course I do not expect that post-Singularity technologies will elevate us 
to super human levels right away, but given enough time (and if it is even 
physically possible) we may eventually become something completely 
different from what we recognize as humans altogether.

Shaviro writes a lot about the future, being connected and the ways in 
which technology will alter our lives. As consumers of technology, we 
tend to think advances are beneficial and will lead us to a better, more 
easily organized and functional life. Shaviro, although admitting that this 
may be true, seems to think that all this connection and surveillance is 
finally going to catch up with humanity in a negative way. 
If all this is true, and online connection will lead to total surveillance and 
the whole world exists “only to be televised,” how do we as mere citizens 
(I mean those not developing these technologies) fall into the trap of 
wanting more? 
How do we see only good arising from such technological advances and 
not become wary of the power of this technology? In a quasi-joking 
manner, is Guy Kawasaki planning to take over the world with said 
technology? After all he attended televangelism training to get people 
pumped up about the Apple brand of products as the coolest way to stay 
connected. 
I particularly liked Shaviro’s chapters “Almost Famous,” “Exposure” and 
“Don’t Look Now.” Our desire to become quasi-celebrities, to have our 
15 minutes, is made easier thanks to the web-cam and Internet. Who 
hasn’t turned the cam or digital recording device on themselves or friends 
and uploaded a video to their blog, YouTube or Facebook page? And why 
do we do so? To keep our friends up to date on our goings on? Or is it 
because, somewhere in the American subconscious, we have become aware 
of the notion that being vain is not only acceptable but warranted?
The scary part is that we can become YouTube sensations overnight 
without even giving our consent. With public surveillance on every 
corner, people and their digital recording devices and the lack of privacy 
rights in public spaces, we can all fall victim to overnight celebrity.

Watching public access webcams is a weird concept to me. The idea that 
while I am walking down the street someone across the country or world 
may be watching me do so is a slightly uncomfortable feeling. 
I chose to watch the webcam located at Times Square in New York at 7th 
and Broadway. The footage mostly consisted of pedestrians jaywalking 
and honking taxis speeding through yellow lights. However, there was the 
occasional thing that caught my eye and drew me away from the crowds 
to zoom in on one person or vehicle. 
For example, the first thing that stood out to me was the white, stretch 
SUV limousine that pulled between two taxis and waited curb side for 
about 5 minutes. I did not see anyone enter or exit the limo but all of 
the sudden it drove away. It made me wonder, who was that limo waiting 
for. Why didn’t they show? Did something terrible happen? As my 
imagination wandered, I thought of many scenarios ranging from Kanye 
West not exiting because of the massive crowds to a mafia deal gone 
wrong. It was fun to imagine that I had just witnessed something related 
to a major crime bust.
A few pedestrians drew my eye as well. For example there was the person 
in all white who seemed to be walking unusually slow. I could not help 
but notice this mummy-like figure leisurely strolling through the crowd. 
I also noticed a person carrying what seemed to be quite a few shopping 
bags drop one and continue walking. This concerned me; it even 
crossed my mind that I was witnessing a terrorist attack. Yet, less than a 
minute later, the pedestrian came running back to retrieve their dropped 
belongings. So why is it that all I could think of was criminal activity 
when I saw these unusual suspects? 
It must have been the readings. Reading about panopticon had gotten 
me thinking about surveying for criminals and behaviors that warranted 
disciplinary actions. Then I started to worry. Are we close to a time when 
everywhere we go will be under constant surveillance? Even in our own 
homes? And then will what happen if the panopticon proves true for 
us? Will constant surveillance and possible discipline eventually lead to a 
better-behaved society who only acts off the basis that they know they are 
being watched? This concerns me. 
In conclusion, watching these webcams got me thinking about the 
negative aspects that can come from too much surveillance but I did enjoy 
watching the unsuspecting passersby for a while.

Courtyard in front of the College of En gineering’s McArthur building on a rainy 
May afternoon. 
In today's age, when virtually everyone I know has a Facebook account, 
you'll be hard pressed to find someone with a Facebook who can honestly 
say they have not "creeped" on someone else. It's easy to do; people post 
information that they know will be easily visible by anyone they allow to 
see it—whether it be their friends, their network, or just anyone with an 
account. I think it's safe to say that everyone with a Facebook knows and 
understands that people are looking at their profile, making judgments 
and looking at their status updates to see what's happening. However we 
do not expect a random person in a completely different country to be 
using a publicly accessible webcam to watch us drive in our cars along the 
highway.
Recently I have been watching random people I don't know via webcams. 
I've watched a South Korean restaurant being run exactly as it would be 
in America. If the website didn't tell me that this restaurant was located 
in South Korea, I probably would have just assumed it was somewhere 
nearby or familiar. I've watched a courtyard in front of a hotel in the 
Netherlands and wondered where people were going, taking note of how 
many of them rode bikes—something I would not typically see here in 
Texas, where cars are by far people's ideal form of transportation. Both 
of these places, in completely different countries, contained people I 
sincerely doubted that I knew, in places I'd never been, going about their 
lives in what seemed to be in a normal way. Everything seemed to be 
running smoothly and people were just going about their day. Except that 
a college student in San Antonio was watching them.
My favorite site was a courtyard at the University of Miami where I found 
the most activity (time differences made it very hard to look at other 
countries) and the best quality. It started with a person I named "green hoodie-guy," who seemed to wander back and forth. He'd go off the 
screen then come back on, with seemingly nowhere else to go. I found 
myself giving my roommate a play by play of green-hoodie-guy and what 
he was doing. Later, I returned to see a couple walking and holding hands, 
with an iPod linking them as they both danced. I assume that the only 
reason they were dancing was because they believed nobody was around to 
see them. Unfortunately, they were wrong, as I was sitting there watching 
them and frantically wondering if I'd ever done something silly like that 
while walking around somewhere with a webcam nearby. 
We, like the people in the panopticon, could theoretically be watched 
at any point. For all I know, somewhere on Trinity campus there is a 
webcam and somewhere there is a website with a link on it, allowing 
random strangers from around the world to see me walking from class, or 
giving a tour, or reading on a bench. And it seems as though this is just 
the start—seeing as how our society continues to become more and more 
reliant on technology. Who knows? Maybe someday these cameras will 
work like Google maps—all you'll need to do is type in an address and 
you can get a live feed of what's going on. It's creepy; it's weird; but it's 
true. Where will this lead us?

I watched the New York Times Square Camera on Monday afternoon. 
The camera is located at 7th and Broadway, about five stories off the 
ground, and is pointing down so that you can see billboards, shops, and 
traffic lights.
There is not much traffic at this time, although there are plenty of 
horns honking at each other. About ten percent of the pedestrians carry 
shopping bags, and there are no discernible conflicts. Some people stop 
and look in windows, while others readjust their clothes and shopping 
bags on the sidewalk. After 15 minutes, the traffic light patterns become 
apparent. It is obviously cold, with many people wearing jackets, but there 
no snow on the ground. The thermometer on the right of the EarthCam 
says it is 37 degrees. I’m sure that if I checked back in 3 weeks from now, 
the advertisements would be different.
It is very interesting to think about how these cameras can be used for 
surveillance. Our society could easily become a disciplinary society, if 
the government were to take that route. With the fear of terrorist attack 
always looming, it would not surprise me for the government to take that 
route unless it was met with fierce public outcry. 
The surveillance could help promote control of society and make us feel 
like we are in a prison. The laws that start from birth (family laws) keep 
evolving throughout the lifetime (school as a factory) and they are always 
enforced in a closed environment. If public space becomes another closed 
environment because of the installation of security cameras, these rules 
would only be further enforced and our privacy would be taken away 
almost completely. 
The world becomes the panopticon described by Jeremy Bentham.

1.29 Bourbon Street (New Orleans) Earth Cam. Segway riders explore the city on 
May 11, 2010.
Considering the Saints just won the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras is just 
around the corner, I decided to watch Bourbon Street In New Orleans. I 
have friends from that area, and they all bragged about the 24/7 party that 
would be occurring between the Super Bowl win and Mardi Gras kick off. 
With all this in mind I decided I would watch the camera at 9:30 p.m. I 
decided on this particular time because I assumed it would give me a good 
mix of people just beginning their night on this notorious party street, as 
well as those who started their nights a little too early. I didn’t really want 
to see a big drunken mess because all of their inhibitions had gone out the 
window on the fifth Bomber Drink! 
Even on Bourbon Street, when sober (or presumably sober), people 
tended to act relatively tame as if “someone was watching.” Well good 
for them, because someone was. In public places, people tend to act 
according to social and societal norms of what is and isn’t appropriate 
because of the possibility that someone, somewhere might be watching 
and judging. Foucault said this is because of society’s control, perpetual 
training and modulation. Basically, we have all become malleable pawns 
in a system of socialization that creates order, control and a constant, 
predictable lameness. 
People break away from these molds from time to time—like when they 
are blasted or think no one is watching—but our public and private 
actions are dictated by these controls.
Sadly, at 9:30 p.m. on Bourbon Street this fine Monday night, only a 
few people were drunk or unconcerned enough to act out against these 
pre-established norms. One lady, decked out in a Saints jersey danced 
her happy ass down the entirety of Bourbon Street until she reached her 
destination: another bar! Two highly over-beaded gentlemen cheered each 
other while walking down the street and one very small man dug in a 
trash can located in front of a bar/restaurant when no one else was in the 
immediate area.
Although creeping on people via random online webcams is a little 
weird and potentially just plain creepy, I plan to do even more crazy, 
unnecessary, and random things in public spaces... and maybe, hopefully, 
someone, somewhere will be watching me.

Starting this assignment at 11:00 at night, I knew I would have trouble 
finding a webcam in a well-lit space. This ruled out pretty much all of 
North America and Europe. Fortunately, for me, the great nation of 
Russia was bound to have a camera set up somewhere that would work. 
I found a camera located in the city of Tomsk. The camera appeared to 
be in a hallway in a university. One wall was covered in photographs, 
possibly of important professors or notable alumni. There was not much 
action other than people holding papers walking by, stopping talk to each 
other, or pausing to look at the wall of photos. A woman came running 
from behind the camera down the hall, but abruptly stopped when she 
noticed someone at the other end of the hall coming towards her.
Now I’m not sure exactly why there is a camera in this hallway. For all I 
know, it could simply be a security camera that the university installed, 
or it could be a webcam that was put up as part of a class project. Heck, 
it might not even be a university that I’m seeing through the camera, but 
possibly an office building or a medical center.
As the readings demonstrate, a camera in a public location like this is not 
the least bit unusual to us. While there are some cameras set up just for 
the sake of having a webcam, most are probably for security purposes. 
Like with the panopticon, those in charge have a means through which 
we can more or less be seen at any time and any place. 
We don’t mind showing up on these cameras, because we understand that 
they are efficient in preventing, or at least deterring, a substantial level of 
crime. In other words, these cameras sufficiently act as a means of control 
in our society. This does not bother us much, since if there’s a security 
camera watching us; chances are we are not within our private sphere 
anyway, which is still practically private. We would not be doing the 
things we may not want caught on film. As the running woman shows, 
how we act when alone is not the same as how we act when other people 
can see us, though of course, we may not always be sure of who’s around.
What this does make one question though, is to what extent are we 
willing to sacrifice this privacy in favor of a greater sense of control? 
Though security cameras such as this one are effective, there is still a great 
level of crime around the world. It can be argued that we still have not 
gone far enough. Hypothetically, if we moved this kind of surveillance 
into every aspect of our lives, we would minimize the level of crime as 
much as possible. But what happens when we start living without the 
privacy we sacrificed to get to this point? And then there’s the question of 
who’s policing the people policing us?
It all comes down to finding a happy medium. There is a place where 
those governing and hopefully looking out for us can suitably survey us 
while we can still keep the private stuff private. It may just take us a while 
to find it.

I have reached a new level of creeperdom. As if Facebook stalking wasn’t 
enough, this strange obsessive curiosity has now led to video surveillance 
surfing. Why, America? Why?
I never thought it was possible to access random video surveillance videos 
via the web; I thought these videos were private. It turns out that anybody

beaches in sandy Miami. The close-proximity videos were most 
interesting. You could actually see peoples’ faces and watch what they are 
doing and who they’re interacting with. 
One of my voyeur videos was a Communication Computer Lab at Ball 
State University in Indiana. You can see a couple guys in the back messing 
around on YouTube and Facebook (which is completely hilarious) and 
the whole world can see it! Hopefully their parents don’t find out about 
this site. At one point, a bunch of the guys in the classroom huddled 
up behind one computer and were watching something on YouTube. It 
was pretty interesting - but I wonder how much more privacy could be 
breached had there been any audio. The up close and personal videos seem 
to be the most interesting to me because you can observe more detail... 
and that’s when I feel the creepiest.
Another interesting camera in Lugano, Switzerland shows the traffic 
patterns on a specific highway. You can make out the letters and numbers 
on the license plates! That blew my mind. People could easily find 
information based on where you are, and what information of yours is out 
in the open. People can know where you are and what you’re doing. 
Voyeurism and inactively participating in other peoples’ lives is a natural 
human curiosity and habit, but this type of surveillance takes things a 
little too far. Do these people have any idea they’re being watched? Do 
they know who is watching? Should they have to feel scared or be careful 
of how they act in public? It’s kind of scary, to imagine that anybody 
could track you down and watch you go about your life at any time 
they want. It’s almost unavoidable, because you never know when you’re 
being taped. And even if you do, you never expect your office video 
surveillance tape to be all over the Internet. Nothing you do is completely 
safe. Whether it’s just Facebooking during class, or getting into a car 
accident on the highway—we can see it, and we can be the judges. This is 
unsettling, but I suppose it has some safety benefits as well for companies 
or states.
Maybe China and Sweden can have hundreds of easily accessible 
surveillance cameras online, but for my own country and my own state to 
have some is bothersome. Land of the... free? Big Brother is watching.

“Sousveillance”
A major theme of this course was 
the question ‘who is watching me?’ 
The fear that modern and emerging 
technologies will ultimately 
converge to effectively end our 
privacy is a legitimate one, and we 
must be wary of who has access to 
our newly-broadcasted lives. 
Currently, the greatest threat to our 
privacy is likely not a government 
or sinister corporation; it is popular 
web services like Google and 
Facebook. These companies have 
constantly adapting and often 
shocking privacy policies that put 
our personal data at risk. 
Take Google for example. Even if 
they don’t share your information 
with anybody, they have access to 
the things you search for online, 
the places you get directions 
to with Google Maps, your 
documents on Google Docs, your 
e-mail on Gmail, and more. It is 
a ton of private data to trust in the 
hands of one company.
That said, most of us don’t do our 
privacy any favors with the way 
we use the web. We put pictures 
of ourselves on Facebook that 
employers would find troubling. 
We check in on Foursquare to 
broadcast wherever we are at any 
given moment. We tweet about 
our lives and our plans. 
Any motivated criminal would 
have no trouble robbing the home 
of a social media over-sharer; he 
could simply check her profiles 
to see if she is out of her house. 
Many of us don’t need a company 
or government looking over our 
shoulder to be under surveillance. 
We do it to ourselves.
Reality Hackers : Connected : Sousveillance 57
I was curious about this 
phenomenon of self-surveillance 
(or “sousveillance”), and wanted to 
bring it to the logical extreme. For 
the majority of a May 1, 2010 I 
broadcasted a video feed of myself 
via Ustream on an embedded 
player in my blog. I promoted it to 
everyone I know via Facebook. I 
also set up a special public Twitter 
profile to update viewers on exactly 
what I was doing and where I was 
going.
The first thing I noticed during the 
broadcast was just how much of a 
pain streaming video of yourself 
really is. Things like Facebook and 
Twitter and even location-based 
networks are popular because they 
are easy, and video streaming clearly 
isn’t quite there yet. You really 
have to modify your behavior to an 
extent to facilitate always having a 
WiFi-connected computer facing 
you, or failing that, a streaming capable phone with enough battery 
power to get you from place to 
place. I know that a few people 
like Justine Ezarik or Justin Kan 
have complicated and expensive 
rigs that make constant streaming 
a reality, but it is still horribly 
inefficient for the everyday person.
Also, I learned that you have to be 
wary of where you are using the 
camera. For example, I was at the 
Spurs practice facility streaming 
from the media holding room, 
but could not stream live from the 
court itself due to team regulations. 
Also, you have to be aware of who 
is around you at any given time, 
and make sure they know that they 
are on camera. Any live-streamer 
who fails notify others that they 
were being broadcast over the 
Internet would be contributing to 
the destruction of not only his own 
privacy, but others’ as well.

1.35 The evolution of privacy on Facebook. Matt McKeon, a software developer affili ated with the Visual Communication Lab of IBM Research’s Center for Social Software, 
created this infographic to depict the gradual erosion of user privacy on the social 
networking site Facebook. McKeon stresses that “I like Facebook,” and notes that 
“it’s helped me reconnect with dozens of people with whom I’d lost touch.” Rather 
than abandoning Facebook altogether, McKeon hopes that readers will pay attention to 
their privacy settings and change them to a comfortable level. For more information, 
see: http://mattmckeon.com/Facebook-privacy/
All this considered, I didn’t feel 
nearly as weird when I was on 
camera than I expected to. 
I thought that I would feel very 
violated and vulnerable open. 
While sometimes I did (especially 
when a coworker texted me to 
tell me I was rubbing my nose a 
lot…I had a cold), for the most 
part I forgot the camera was there 
and went about my daily activities. 
Only when I had to really think 
about the camera (when I was 
planning to move, for example) was 
I totally aware that I was on video. 
I think the day will soon come that 
this kind of life streaming is simple 
and cheap enough for mainstream 
adoption. First generation 
models of consumer life-logging 
hardware are already on sale, and 
future advances in the technology 
will likely make these devices as 
commonplace as smart phones are 
now. 
From there, somebody will 
inevitably create a web service that 
will encourage us to make these life 
logs public, a process known as life 
caching. It may seem foreign to 
us now, but Facebook and Twitter 
would have been laughed at ten 
years ago. The demand to make 
our lives public will be there; it 
always has been. At this point it 
is just a matter of the technology 
catching up.

“Deactivate: The wait”
“Good morning, Cory,” my alarm clock sounded loudly from my 
computer, in the booming voice of Morgan Freeman, and repeated every 
three steady seconds, “Wake up, Cory.”
I power launched my pillow across my room and blindly stumbled out 
of bed to my desktop. My eyes cracked open a little more to a bright 
computer screen with Morgan Freeman’s face smiling back at me. I waved 
at my webcam with one hand while rubbing the sleep out of my eye with 
the other.
 “I’m awake,” I grumbled. Morgan cracked a smile and shook his head.
“You sure? Don’t make me sound off again in fifteen minutes…”
I sighed and answered in an exasperated tone, “Yes, I’m sure.”
My alarm deactivated; he smiled and faded off my computer screen as I 
sat down to read the news on the window behind my daily schedule. My 
friends always made fun of me for choosing Morgan Freeman as my alarm 
clock default, but I think it’s pretty damn cool. My best friend, Dan, has 
his set to Megan Fox, but I think it’s totally tacky. She says really stupid, 
creepy things like “Wake up honey, I’ve got a surprise for you,” and I just 
find it unrealistic and tasteless. Globalex recently came out with 200 new 
alarm defaults – most of them are those young annoying Disney pop 
artists – and they’ve been selling like crazy. But I’m satisfied with my five 
dollar Morgan Freeman alarm clock – his voice is soothing and wakes me 
up just fine.
I clicked the coffee button at the top-right corner and peered out my 
bedroom door towards the kitchen in my small apartment. After a short 
pause, I heard my coffee percolator make a gurgling noise as it began 
to make a fresh brew. Looking back at my screen, the Globalex Times 
unfolded to today’s top stories. I yawned and stretched backwards, nearly 
falling out of my chair. It didn’t take me much by surprise, considering 
the fact that I always nearly fall out of my chair in my morning routine. 
My habits synced up so quickly, I barely take notice to them anymore. 
Globalex has been running my life for me since as far back as I can 
remember, so I didn’t really have to think about it. It evolved so quickly. 
First it was just a social networking site, and then it added on video 
capabilities. Soon after that, it was a news source, banking and finance 
site, business network database, and a command station all in one. 
Globalex slowly kind of became the hub of the world, and nobody really 
saw it coming.
Pilfering through the headlines, there was nothing that special… Vitamin 
supplements now substitute as food for busy people on the go; Cher 
becomes oldest baby boomer of all time at the age of 147, coming out 
with new album; Globalex finally wins battle against Microsoft, company 
goes under. This news had been circulating for months now, and it just

seemed like all this stuff was just beginning to surface. We’ve all been 
aware that scientists were messing around with vitamin complexes to see if 
they could get humans to live off of them, and of course, they succeeded. 
Whoever actually follows through with living off nutrients from pills, 
I have a lot of respect for them, although I can’t imagine a life without 
cheese fries. And everybody knew that Cher was competing with some old 
rich lady from Delaware for oldest baby boomer, but that poor lady had 
a failed heart transplant and they couldn’t bring her back. I don’t see how 
they couldn’t, considering the lady managed to live to be 147 years old… 
but it’s only the ridiculously rich people who can afford to live that long. 
Like most normal middle-class folk, my parents will die at around their 
eighties or nineties, if they’re lucky. As for me, I’m only twenty-three, so 
I feel like I don’t have to think about that right now. I just hope that by 
the time I start getting old and brittle, some new world order will have 
taken place and everybody will have the option of living well into their 
two-hundreds. As comforting as that sounds, I just don’t see what I could 
possibly do with my time for that long. There aren’t enough video games 
in the world.
In the middle of my daydream, I was startled by my computer ringing. I 
looked at the screen and saw that my mom was calling. I inhaled sharply 
and stretched.
“Answer,” I said in a stern, monotone voice. Mom’s face popped up in a 
square window and she was beaming a smile at me. I clearly looked like I 
just rolled out of bed.
“Oh, honey, it’s almost three in the afternoon! Why are you just getting 
up?” she said with a sweet grin on her face. My little sister, Iris, was 
jumping around and waving in the background, and I waved back while 
scratching my stubble with my free hand.
“It’s the weekend, mom…”
“Alright, well… your father just got back from India. You should pass him 
a note when you get the chance,” she squinted at me, probably noticing 
my hair was scruffy and going in all different directions.
“Yeah… I’ve been meaning to tell you… My Palm is kind of on off-time 
right now. I need to get the hard drive fixed,” I cringed as the expression 
on her face fell.
“What? Honey, the LexPalm we bought you is barely two months old!”
“I know, but it got overheated or something. I’ll get it fixed.”
“No, check on your doorstep in about five minutes. I’m putting in a temp 
order for you. It should be there no later than that.”
“…okay. Thanks.”
“Of course – we’ll figure out what happened to your old one. Love you!”

she waved goodbye and logged out of our video conversation. I rolled my 
eyes and let out a big sigh.
I didn’t really want the new LexPalm. If I had it my way, I wouldn’t have a 
profile on the Globalex server. I have been trying to become independent 
of this system for about a month now. I feel like I’m the only one who 
feels a privacy invasion that nobody else is noticing. About two weeks 
ago when Dan and I were chatting over the Globalex chat domain, he 
asked me if I wanted to go cruising with him to Westridge Park so we 
could smoke a bowl. After I agreed and signed off, I went to pick him up 
at his apartment and we went cruising. About five minutes before we got 
to Westridge Park, we slowly started getting followed by some cop cars. 
We tried to lose them, but more cars kept showing up; we finally decided 
to turn back around and go back to my place. At one point, I remember 
telling Dan not to talk anymore because I felt like our conversation was 
bugged, so our car ride home was totally silent. Even though what we 
were going to do was illegal, it was the seediest feeling to think that maybe 
our conversations were starting to be hacked by the city. We were being 
listened to and followed… monitored by the government. I get that it’s a 
form of control in an effort to keep things safe, but for some reason I just 
feel like there are some rules being broken and lines being crossed. 
The same thing happened last weekend when my friend, Artie, sent out 
a mass invitation to his networks for his going-away party. It was at his 
house and the invitation promised three kegs and a bunch of other booze. 
The party literally got busted before it even started, and Artie got arrested 
for supplying alcohol to minors. We all had to drive by his house, acting 
like we weren’t involved so we wouldn’t get in trouble, too. People kept 
arguing afterwards about how the cops could have known about the party 
before it even started; there were no noise complaints, no cars lining up 
the street, no signs of a party whatsoever. Artie actually blamed a lot of 
his friends for reporting him, but everyone denied it, and rightfully so. 
I knew deep down that there was something happening differently in 
the Globalex server; there were new terms that people weren’t aware of, 
or even worse, there were no terms at all and the server slowly became a 
surveillance system. Ever since Artie’s bust, I’ve been doing little tests of 
my own to investigate. So far, all evidence points to secret surveillance.
“Hey loser,” Dan’s hands clutched my shoulders hard as he abruptly 
showed up behind my chair. I was really startled, so I jumped up.
“Jesus! You know, there’s this thing called knocking…,” I turned around 
to him laughing under his breath.
“Yeah, well, that’s not my thing. I picked this up at your porch. Did 
your other one break or something?” he handed me my new temporary 
LexPalm and I shoved it to the side.
“Thanks…”
He raised his eyebrow and patted my back, “What’re you up to? You look 
pissed.”

“Nah, I was just thinking about stuff.” I scratched the back of my neck 
nervously and he gave me a strange look while plopping onto my couch.
“Such as…?” he kicked back and looked up at me, still standing in my 
room without any real direction.
“Do you remember when Artie’s kegger got busted last weekend?”
“Yeah, it sucked. Why?”
“I’ve just really been thinking about it, and-” he cut me off and sat up 
straight.
“Whoa, you weren’t the one who told on him, were you?!”
“NO. No, that’s not what it is. I didn’t do that,” I assured him as he 
teetered back down onto my sofa, relieved. 
“Alright, well, what about it?”
“You ever think the cops maybe got a hold of his invitation?” I said 
hesitantly as he snorted with laughter.
“Yeah, because the police have nothing better to do than go through our 
social networks and figure out how to rain on our parades… Sounds 
like ‘Facebook Stalking’ back in the 2000s. That’s hilarious, dude. But 
honestly? Just a little ridiculous.”
We both heard a loud beep from the kitchen, and Dan bolted upwards, 
“One sec. Hold that thought. Coffee.”
He then came back with two mugs of hot coffee that I had commanded 
off the server; they were piping hot and brewed perfectly. I took a small, 
careful sip and adjusted my posture.
“No, I’m serious! Look, you’re my best friend, and I trust that you’d take 
what I say seriously. I really think there’s something up with the Globalex 
server. I think lately they’ve changed something. I mean, is it not weird 
that now every time I talk about doing something bad, like smoking a 
bowl with you or getting a fake ID, the cops are somehow nearby? Or 
like when I asked you about the website for the free pirated movies? The 
minute you sent me the link, both of our computers shut off in two 
different locations. Do you not think that’s weird?”
Dan sat back and considered what I said very seriously. He pursed his 
lips and let out a big sigh while scratching his scalp, “Well, what do you 
want to do about it? It’s not like you can do anything. That server is pretty 
much our life.”
I paced around my room anxiously, “Yeah, but it doesn’t have to be. We 
don’t have to be dependent on the stupid server. We can go back to how 
things were, where our credit cards and phones and alarm clocks and

briefcases were all separate things. It was so much better when life was like 
that.”
Dan propped himself up with a stern look on his face, clearly trying to 
level with me. He took a short sip of his coffee and cleared his throat, 
“Look, Cory, I don’t think things will ever go back to being that difficult. 
It’s just too much to keep track of, you know? The server made it easy, and 
it’s been this was for such a long time. You’ve got to keep your head out 
of those history books, dude. We can’t just go back 200 years with all that 
completely useless, one-dimensional stuff like Facebook and the oPhone.”
“iPhone.”
“Whatever. History is boring. What I’m saying is, it’s not going to change 
back. That crap is so primitive. I really don’t see how people functioned, 
and I’m not about to find out.” He took a larger sip of his coffee and 
closed his eyes, looking very pleased with the brew.
“I actually thought it was pretty efficient. The thought of people actually 
doing things for themselves, working at their own projects, keeping their 
social and business lives separate,” I exasperatedly gestured to the mug in 
his hand, “making their own coffee…”
“Alright, so what do you suppose we do, then?”
“Cut ourselves off. Become self-sufficient. See if we can inspire other 
people to break free from this. It’s a trap – that’s what people don’t see.” I 
spoke defiantly and saw he was genuinely listening, and I could almost see 
a bit of fear in his eyes of the situation. I could see the wheels spinning in 
his head. He took one last gulp of his coffee, and grunted from the heat 
slightly burning his throat.
He set his coffee mug down and looked at me confidently, “Fine. Let’s do 
it. Let’s delete our profiles.”
I was completely taken aback, “Really? You want to?”
“Yeah. Let’s see if we can actually do it,” he replied without missing a beat.
Within minutes, we both logged onto Globalex for the last time and 
deactivated our accounts. Three alert messages popped up to warn us of 
the ramifications of deactivating our profiles on the server, but we clicked 
‘confirm’ and suddenly the computer shut off. I tried turning it back on, 
but it was as if the computer was dead. 
“What happened? Why won’t it turn on?” Dan slightly panicked.
“I don’t know. Let’s wait,” I tried to keep my cool, but could feel my chest 
begin to tighten with anxiety.
Dan reached for his LexPalm and saw it shut down in his very own hands, 
and it stayed off during his many attempts at restarting the device. He

began to breathe heavily and pace around the room.
“It’s not even turning on, Cory!”
“That’s what’s supposed to happen! Just give it a while! You’re the one who 
said we needed to see if we could do it!”
He threw himself onto my couch and stared at the ceiling, trying to calm 
himself down. I reached for my old cell phone and turned it on, only to 
see there was no service. Without my LexPalm and my computer, I had 
no way of contacting anyone. Dan stayed on the couch while I grabbed 
my keys and ran out to my car. I pressed the unlock button, and the car 
successfully unlocked, but the ignition key was deactivated along with my 
user profile. I had no car at this point. I ran back inside and sat on my 
bed, trying to get a hold of my nerves.
“My car won’t start. And my cell phone doesn’t work. And I can’t access 
my bank account, or anything.”
I could hear Dan whimper under his breath, “Then what now? We have to 
reactivate our accounts. We have to.” I got a large lump in my throat and 
threw my LexPalm across the room.
“We can’t.”
“What do you mean we can’t? That’s technology! We can go back and fix 
it!”
“Remember those three warning alerts before we deactivated? Did you 
even read them?” I yelled.
“No! That was your job! What the hell did it say?!” he yelled back at me.
“We are eligible to reapply for membership to the server in six months. 
Our profiles are being deconstructed. Our bank accounts, personal 
information, documents, contacts – everything is being taken apart.”
“WHY did you click ‘okay’?!” he stood up and frantically yelled. I buried 
my head in my hands and just sat on my bed, completely quiet. I think I 
might have stayed that way for hours.
That was the day that started my six months without reading the news, 
without commanding coffee, without contacting a single soul on this 
earth, or accessing my money. These were the six months that my mom 
had to bring me food and drive me around town to do things both 
trivial and important – I had nothing to my name. These were the six 
months where I couldn’t watch movies, or television, or any form of 
entertainment. These were the six months where I didn’t qualify for any 
medical or dental checkups, because I didn’t have an ‘identity profile.’ 
These were the six months where I didn’t have an identity at all.

Ekaterina Sedia’s work “Mind of A Pig” made me want to write 
a fiction piece about what the world might face in the future if all 
these technologies that we have been discussing in class become reality. 
She does such a good job weaving words together to believe that her 
societies exist. 
In class, we talked about the Singularity and the idea both frightened 
and excited me. While I do not believe there will be a single moment 
where the Singularity would become a reality. I do believe there 
could be a gradual process where we start incorporating ourselves into 
machines. I wanted to look at a society where the Singularity was 
about happen. How would society take it? In stride? As something that 
needed to be combatted? 
Annalee Newitz asked if we should be worried about the government 
taking over our lives with all these technologies that can track our 
movements. I decided to take that idea one step further. What would 
happen if companies own the government? Not only could they track 
our movements, but they could create laws calling rivals’ works illegal 
so that the population would only be able to buy the company who 
controls the government’s property.

in the gaming community. The world comes down to two products:

Microsoft is putting out a new game “to end all games.” Not sure what 
that means, but hey the government is behind this so what can be the 
harm? Many of you remember the merger of Sony and Macintosh back 
in 2025 and we thought that was big news, but now MacSony seems to 
have the synergy that has made Microsoft so profitable the last few years. 
On channel MacSony (sorry if you don’t have Direct TV just believe me 
when I tell you this) the announcement was made and a 5% increase in 
stock was reported, but on Microsoft 2 (sorry if you don’t have DishTV, 
you’ll have to believe me on this too) they’re saying there was a decrease of 
5% in stock today? Well, I have no clue what the hell that means, but I’m 
sure the government will figure it out. At the very least, it’s a win for us 
gamers. Let the showdown begin!

Bad news, gamers. It sounds like Life is going to be more expensive than 
we originally thought it would be, but on the plus side, it sounds like this 
is going to be the last game you will ever need to buy. Just like Microsoft’s 
EGG (Extracurricular Gaming Guru), it looks like the system will be full 
body and will be able to read your thoughts. The new application? You 
can be plugged in for more than the four hours that the EGG allows you 
to be plugged in. Awesome. MacSony better step their game up. Release 
date for Life: April 30th. Countdown: 51 days.
The new numbers that came out from the government, as funded by 
MacSony and Microsoft (the only thing they work on together in 
the government) estimated that 49% of American households have a 
Microsoft EGG and 48% have a MacSony FILE (Formatted In-Living 
Experience). So, ladies and gentlemen, this may be the final showdown 
between the two companies if MacSony can get together a system to 
compete against Life.

Not sure why I’m up, but Yahoo released an announcement saying that 
Living will come out on April 30th too. Guess that merger with Nintendo 
made sense after all. Wow, this is getting intense.
March 30th 2029 5:13 pm
Well sounds like the war has begun and Microsoft has taken the first shot. 
Google today (controlled by Microsoft if you noobs didn’t know that 
already) explained that the system will fail miserably because of a bug 
already planted into it by a rogue MacSony employee. The government 
is fighting because the Microsoft side and the MacSony side are throwing 
allegations at each other that there has been tampering of equipment. 
Telling you folks, this is getting good.

The MacSony vs. Microsoft war is official: casualties have been suffered. A 
news report today from California reported that servers recorded that 56 
people were killed today over an argument about the new gaming systems 
of MacSony and Microsoft. On the hugely popular MMORPG Battlefield: 
Virtual Reality, a MacSony supporter hacked the game on the Micro-FILE 
server (the EGG server for Microsoft) and put the MacSony-EGG servers 
users in the realm of the Micro-FILE’s servers where the MacSony-EGG 
users slaughtered the characters of the Micro-FILE users. The president, 
elected from the Microsoft party, called this “an act of cyber-terrorism 
that is an attack on American freedom. We Americans should not have to 
worry about our lives being hacked by others.” Bummer dude, because it 
totally happened. You cannot and will not find the guy who did it.
April 3rd 2029 8:05 pm
Microsoft announced they will not be fixing the servers and instead be 
focusing on Life. Interesting move on their part, hope the loyal followers 
don’t get mad at the company for making them wait to buy Life.
April 5th 2029 8:57 am
Congress passed a bill demanding MacSony’s records so they can find 
the cyber-terrorist who hacked Microsoft’s servers. Unfortunately, that 
will not happen since MacSony’s main servers are located in Japan. 
The U.S. is just trying to protect their own interest in Microsoft. Since 
the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, you will remember 
that corporations have basically “bought” their legislators. That trend 
unfolded in other democracies and now the two companies, MacSony and 
Microsoft, now run the world’s governments. Obviously, Microsoft has 
the majority in America and MacSony has the majority in Japan. This is 
the first time that MacSony and Microsoft have attacked each other at an 
international level. The Microsoft minority in Japan tried to pass the same 
bill, but of course was struck down by the MacSony majority. This means 
that MacSony is untouchable by U.S. law. Like I said, no one will know 
the mystery behind the Virtual Reality hacker.

Both sides are quieting down as the final push is being made with a 
media blitz happening on all forms of media: TV, Internet, you name 
it, it’s being pimped out by MacSony or Microsoft’s media outlets (e.g. 
MacSony’s DirectTV/Yahoo and Microsoft’s DishTV/Google). Also, 
the bashing of the opponents’ machines is quite prevalent with both 
having catchy slogans about the other’s faults. MacSony’s tag is “Why 
get unplugged in Life? Stay Living.” Microsoft’s tag is “We can give you 
Life, others can’t.” The human race has not seen this kind of competition. 
Whoever wins this battle affects the control of information, and thusly, 
the world.
April 7th 2029 5:16 pm
My inside man at Microsoft claimed there was a major failure with the 
machines today. A test run with a subject went wrong. The power went 
out in the section where the test was happening and the subject passed 
away. What does this mean? When our power plants stop working, we 
die? This is what everyone is worried about since the first plugged in 
game came to home. Yes, there have been deaths, especially the famed 
assassination of President Riley in 2018, but there is no risk when 
everyone is plugged into the system. Will this curtail the sales? Yeah, a 
little bit, but people will come… they will come.
Nothing new from my MacSony inside man. Sounds like they are still 
going through all the information still given to them from Nintendo. 
MacSony needs the information from Nintendo because it sounded like 
they were working on their big comeback project, which has now been 
transferred into MacSony’s Life.

the idea. People were allowed to step inside and look around for a few 
minutes in the new world. At the very least I call this utopia. Microsoft 
was completely right, Life does in fact read your brainwaves and sets up 
Life how you want it. People have been wondering how you can stay 
inside of Life for the rest of your life. Simply put, you will be “plugged in” 
and instead of vitamins running through your veins, pure energy will be 
circulating your body making YOU the battery. This means that you can 
be turned on FOREVER if you aren’t unplugged. If you are, a sensor will 
go off in the Microsoft offices and someone will be there to plug you back 
in within a few minutes. Your body, when used as a battery, can last up to 
3 years.

I have been around the Microsoft booth for now over 2 hours and 
the machine is functioning properly. Just gorgeous all around. The 
possible of worry about the unplugging of the machine (or hacking by 
MacSony) is still there, but that didn’t decrease the turnout at E3, it was 
just announced that they broke records and 1.3 billion people are here 
today. This obviously is the life-changing experience everyone has been 
expecting.

Went to the MacSony booth, but unfortunately they said they were 
having problems with the machine and no one could go inside. Well, 
bummer. So far I would chalk this round up to Microsoft, but the 
war isn’t over yet. MacSony did have the Living program set up in a 
FILE where the program for Living was uploaded, but without the 
necessary tools like Microsoft has for Life that keeps you alive in the real 
world while you are playing the game, MacSony has no chance to beat 
Microsoft.

whole buying Nintendo thing was a red herring to worry Microsoft into 
putting out a bad product. Not only did MacSony take on the debt of the 
failing Nintendo, but Nintendo suckered MacSony into the deal because 
Nintendo supposedly had the technology copied from Microsoft HQ and 
told MacSony they had it! Of course this means that MacSony will declare

WIKIPEDIA
“Transhumanism”
Transhumanism is an international intellectual and cultural movement 
supporting the use of science and technology to improve human mental 
and physical characteristics and capacities. The movement regards aspects 
of the human condition, such as disability, suffering, disease, aging, and 
involuntary death as unnecessary and undesirable. Transhumanists look 
to biotechnologies and other emerging technologies for these purposes. 
Dangers, as well as benefits, are also of concern to the transhumanist 
movement. 1
The term “transhumanism” is symbolized by H+ or h+ and is often used 
as a synonym for “human enhancement”. 2
 Although the first known use 
of the term dates from 1957, the contemporary meaning is a product 
of the 1980s when futurists in the United States began to organize what 
has since grown into the transhumanist movement. Transhumanist 
thinkers predict that human beings may eventually be able to transform 
themselves into beings with such greatly expanded abilities as to merit 
the label “posthuman”. Transhumanism is therefore sometimes referred to 
as “posthumanism” or a form of transformational activism influenced by 
posthumanist ideals. 3
The transhumanist vision of a transformed future humanity has attracted 
many supporters and detractors from a wide range of perspectives. 
Transhumanism has been described by one critic, Francis Fukuyama, as 
the world’s most dangerous idea,4
 while one proponent, Ronald Bailey, 
counters that it is the “movement that epitomizes the most daring, 
courageous, imaginative, and idealistic aspirations of humanity”. 5
According to philosophers who have studied and written about the 
history of transhumanist thought,transcendentalist impulses have been 
expressed at least as far back as in the quest for immortality in the Epic 
of Gilgamesh, as well as historical quests for the Fountain of Youth, Elixir 
of Life, and other efforts to stave off aging and death. Transhumanist 
philosophy, however, is rooted in Renaissance humanism and the 
Enlightenment. For example, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola called 
on people to “sculpt their own statue”, and the Marquis de Condorcet 
speculated about the use of medical science to indefinitely extend the 
human life span, while Benjamin Franklin dreamed of suspended 
animation, and after Charles Darwin “it became increasingly plausible 
to view the current version of humanity not as the endpoint of evolution 
but rather as a possibly quite early phase.” However, Friedrich Nietzsche 
is considered by some to be less of an influence, despite his exaltation 
of the “overman”, due to his emphasis on self-actualization rather than 
technological transformation. 
Nikolai Fyodorov, a 19th-century Russian philosopher, advocated 
radical life extension, physical immortality and even resurrection of 
the dead using scientific methods. 6
 In the 20th century, a direct and 
influential precursor to transhumanist concepts was geneticist J.B.S. 
Haldane’s 1923 essay Daedalus: Science and the Future, which predicted 
2.1 Aimee Mullins. Highlighted in the 
blog io9 as part of the “Portraits in 
Posthumanity” series, Aimee Mullins is 
an athlete, an activist, and a former 
intelligence analyst with the US Pentagon. 
As the biography on her personal site 
explains, Mullins was “born without fibulae 
in both legs.” Doctors amputated both of 
her legs below the knee and equipped her 
with prosthetic extensions. “Her likeness 
has been immortalized in exhibits at 
institutions such as the Smithsonian, the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art, the NCAA Hall 
of Fame, the Victoria and Albert Museum, 
the Tate Modern, the Track and Field Hall 
of Fame, and the Women’s Museum, where she 
is honored for her contribution to sport 
among the “Greatest American Women of the 
20th Century.” To learn more, visit her

that great benefits would come from applications of advanced sciences 
to human biology—and that every such advance would first appear 
to someone as blasphemy or perversion, “indecent and unnatural”. J. 
D. Bernal speculated about space colonization, bionic implants, and 
cognitive enhancement, which have been common transhumanist 
themes since then. Biologist Julian Huxley, brother of author Aldous 
Huxley (a childhood friend of Haldane’s), appears to have been the first 
to use the actual word “transhumanism”. Writing in 1957, he defined 
transhumanism as “man remaining man, but transcending himself, by 
realizing new possibilities of and for his human nature”. 7
 This definition 
differs, albeit not substantially, from the one commonly in use since the 
1980s.
Computer scientist Marvin Minsky wrote on relationships between 
human and artificial intelligence beginning in the 1960s. 8
 Over the 
succeeding decades, this field continued to generate influential thinkers, 
such as Hans Moravec and Raymond Kurzweil, who oscillated between 
the technical arena and futuristic speculations in the transhumanist vein. 
9, 10 The coalescence of an identifiable transhumanist movement began in 
the last decades of the 20th century. In 1966, FM-2030 (formerly F.M. 
Esfandiary), a futurist who taught “new concepts of the Human” at the 
The New School in New York City, began to identify people who adopt 
technologies, lifestyles and world views transitional to “posthumanity” as 
“transhuman” (short for “transitory human”). 11 In 1972, Robert Ettinger 
contributed to the conceptualization of “transhumanity” in his book Man 
into Superman. 12, 13 FM-2030 published the Upwingers Manifesto in 1973 
to stimulate transhumanly conscious activism. 14
The first self-described transhumanists met formally in the early 1980s 
at the University of California, Los Angeles, which became the main 
center of transhumanist thought. Here, FM-2030 lectured on his 
“Third Way” futurist ideology. At the EZTV Media venue frequented 
by transhumanists and other futurists, Natasha Vita-More presented 
Breaking Away, her 1980 experimental film with the theme of humans 
breaking away from their biological limitations and the Earth’s gravity 
as they head into space. 15, 16 FM-2030 and Vita-More soon began 
holding gatherings for transhumanists in Los Angeles, which included 
students from FM-2030’s courses and audiences from Vita-More’s artistic 
productions. In 1982, Vita-More authored the Transhumanist Arts 
Statement,
17 and, six years later, produced the cable TV show TransCentury 
Update on transhumanity, a program which reached over 100,000 viewers.
In 1986, Eric Drexler published Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of 
Nanotechnology,
18 which discussed the prospects for nanotechnology and 
molecular assemblers, and founded the Foresight Institute. As the first 
non-profit organization to research, advocate for, and perform cryonics, 
the Southern California offices of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation 
became a center for futurists. In 1988, the first issue of Extropy Magazine 
was published by Max More and Tom Morrow. In 1990, More, a strategic 
philosopher, created his own particular transhumanist doctrine, which 
took the form of the Principles of Extropy,19 and laid the foundation of 
modern transhumanism by giving it a new definition:20
2.2 She’s got legs. She knows how to 
use them. This photograph, reprinted 
from the blog io9, depicts just a few 
of Aimee Mullins’ prosthetic legs. In a 
series of inspiring posts written for the 
blog Gizmodo, Mullins explains that “In 
my functional daily arsenal, I have a 
general rotation between what I call the 
‘Robocop’ legs (Re-Flex VSP Legs made by 
Ossur) and my cosmetic, very life-like 
legs (by Dorset Orthopaedic).” Mullins 
notes that none of these legs are covered 
by insurance because “No other aspect 
of daily living other than using the 
bathroom is considered ‘necessary,’ which 
means your basic prosthetic given to most 
amputees—a stick with a rubber foot as a 
leg, or a stick with a hook on the end 
as an arm, has fundamentally not changed 
since WWII.” Readers are encouraged to

Google for “gizmodo and aimee mullins.”
76 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : What is transhumanism?
Transhumanism is a class of philosophies that seek to guide us 
towards a posthuman condition. Transhumanism shares many 
elements of humanism, including a respect for reason and 
science, a commitment to progress, and a valuing of human (or 
transhuman) existence in this life. […] Transhumanism differs 
from humanism in recognizing and anticipating the radical 
alterations in the nature and possibilities of our lives resulting 
from various sciences and technologies […].
In 1992, More and Morrow founded the Extropy Institute, a catalyst for 
networking futurists and brainstorming new memeplexes by organizing 
a series of conferences and, more importantly, providing a mailing list, 
which exposed many to transhumanist views for the first time during 
the rise of cyberculture and the cyberdelic counterculture. In 1998, 
philosophers Nick Bostrom and David Pearce founded the World 
Transhumanist Association (WTA), an international non-governmental 
organization working toward the recognition of transhumanism as a 
legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and public policy. 21 In 1999, 
the WTA drafted and adopted The Transhumanist Declaration. 22 The 
Transhumanist FAQ, prepared by the WTA, gave two formal definitions 
for transhumanism:23
The intellectual and cultural movement that affirms the possibility 
and desirability of fundamentally improving the human 
condition through applied reason, especially by developing and 
making widely available technologies to eliminate aging and to 
greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological 
capacities.
The study of the ramifications, promises, and potential dangers of 
technologies that will enable us to overcome fundamental human 
limitations, and the related study of the ethical matters involved in 
developing and using such technologies.
A number of similar definitions have been collected by Anders Sandberg, 
an academic and prominent transhumanist. 24
In possible contrast with other transhumanist organizations, WTA 
officials considered that social forces could undermine their futurist 
visions and needed to be addressed. 25 A particular concern is the equal 
access to human enhancement technologies across classes and borders. 26
In 2006, a political struggle within the transhumanist movement between 
the libertarian right and the liberal left resulted in a more centre-leftward 
positioning of the WTA under its former executive director James 
Hughes. 26, 27 In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute 
ceased operations of the organization, stating that its mission was 
“essentially completed”. 28 This left the World Transhumanist Association 
as the leading international transhumanist organization. In 2008, as 
part of a rebranding effort, the WTA changed its name to “Humanity+” 
in order to project a more humane image. 29 Humanity Plus and

Reality Hackers : Transhuman : What is transhumanism? 77
Betterhumans publish h+ Magazine, a periodical edited by R. U. Sirius 
which disseminates transhumanist news and ideas. 30, 31
Theory
It is a matter of debate whether transhumanism is a branch of 
“posthumanism” and how posthumanism should be conceptualized 
with regard to transhumanism. The latter is often referred to as a variant 
or activist form of posthumanism by its conservative,Christian32 and 
progressive33, 34 critics, but also by pro-transhumanist scholars who, for 
example, characterise it as a subset of “philosophical posthumanism”. A 
common feature of transhumanism and philosophical posthumanism is 
the future vision of a new intelligent species, into which humanity will 
evolve, which will supplement humanity or supersede it. Transhumanism 
stresses the evolutionary perspective, including sometimes the creation of 
a highly intelligent animal species by way of cognitive enhancement (i.e. 
biological uplift), but clings to a “posthuman future” as the final goal of 
participant evolution. 35
Nevertheless, the idea to create intelligent artificial beings, proposed, for 
example, by roboticist Hans Moravec, has influenced transhumanism. 
Moravec’s ideas and transhumanism have also been characterized as a 
“complacent” or “apocalyptic” variant of posthumanism and contrasted 
with “cultural posthumanism” in humanities and the arts. 36 While such a 
“cultural posthumanism” would offer resources for rethinking the relations 
of humans and increasingly sophisticated machines, transhumanism 
and similar posthumanisms are, in this view, not abandoning obsolete 
concepts of the “autonomous liberal subject” but are expanding its 
“prerogatives” into the realm of the posthuman. 37 Transhumanist self characterizations as a continuation of humanism and Enlightenment 
thinking correspond with this view.
Some secular humanists conceive transhumanism as an offspring of the 
humanist free thought movement and argue that transhumanists differ 
from the humanist mainstream by having a specific focus on technological 
approaches to resolving human concerns and on the issue of mortality.38
However, other progressives have argued that posthumanism, whether 
it be its philosophical or activist forms, amounts to a shift away from 
concerns about social justice, from the reform of human institutions and 
from other Enlightenment preoccupations, toward narcissistic longings 
for a transcendence of the human body in quest of more exquisite ways 
of being. 39 In this view, transhumanism is abandoning the goals of 
humanism, the Enlightenment, and progressive politics.
Aims
While many transhumanist theorists and advocates seek to apply 
reason, science and technology for the purposes of reducing poverty, 
disease, disability, and malnutrition around the globe, transhumanism 
is distinctive in its particular focus on the applications of technologies 
to the improvement of human bodies at the individual level. Many

78 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : What is transhumanism?
transhumanists actively assess the potential for future technologies and 
innovative social systems to improve the quality of all life, while seeking 
to make the material reality of the human condition fulfill the promise of 
legal and political equality by eliminating congenital mental and physical 
barriers.
Transhumanist philosophers argue that there not only exists a perfectionist 
ethical imperative for humans to strive for progress and improvement of 
the human condition but that it is possible and desirable for humanity to 
enter a transhuman phase of existence, in which humans are in control of 
their own evolution. In such a phase, natural evolution would be replaced 
with deliberate change.
Some theorists, such as Raymond Kurzweil, think that the pace of 
technological innovation is accelerating and that the next 50 years may 
yield not only radical technological advances but possibly a Technological 
Singularity, which may fundamentally change the nature of human 
beings. 40 Transhumanists who foresee this massive technological change 
generally maintain that it is desirable. However, some are also concerned 
with the possible dangers of extremely rapid technological change 
and propose options for ensuring that advanced technology is used 
responsibly. For example, Bostrom has written extensively on existential 
risks to humanity’s future welfare, including risks that could be created by 
emerging technologies. 41
Ethics
Transhumanists engage in interdisciplinary approaches to understanding 
and evaluating possibilities for overcoming biological limitations. 
They draw on futurology and various fields of ethics such as bioethics, 
infoethics, nanoethics, neuroethics, roboethics, and technoethics 
mainly but not exclusively from a philosophically utilitarian, socially 
progressive, politically and economically liberal perspective. Unlike 
many philosophers, social critics, and activists who place a moral value 
on preservation of natural systems, transhumanists see the very concept 
of the specifically “natural” as problematically nebulous at best, and an 
obstacle to progress at worst. 42 In keeping with this, many prominent 
transhumanist advocates refer to transhumanism’s critics on the political 
right and left jointly as “bioconservatives” or “bioluddites”, the latter term 
alluding to the 19th century anti-industrialisation social movement that 
opposed the replacement of human manual labourers by machines. 43

Reality Hackers : Transhuman : What is the Singularity? 79
80 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : What is the Singularity?
ANNALEE NEWITZ
“What is the Singularity and will you live to see it?”
If you read any science fiction or futurism, you’ve probably heard people using 
the term “Singularity” to describe the world of tomorrow. But what exactly 
does it mean, and where does the idea come from? 
What is the Singularity?
The term Singularity describes the moment when a civilization changes 
so much that its rules and technologies are incomprehensible to previous 
generations. Think of it as a point-of-no-return in history.
Most thinkers believe the Singularity will be jump-started by extremely 
rapid technological and scientific changes. These changes will be so fast, 
and so profound, that every aspect of our society will be transformed, 
from our bodies and families to our governments and economies.
A good way to understand the Singularity is to imagine explaining the 
Internet to somebody living in the year 1200. Your frames of reference 
would be so different that it would be almost impossible to convey how 
the Internet works, let alone what it means to our society. You are on the 
other side of what seems like a Singularity to our person from the Middle 
Ages. But from the perspective of a future Singularity, we are the medieval 
ones. Advances in science and technology mean that singularities might 
happen over periods much shorter than 800 years. And nobody knows for 
sure what the hell they’ll bring.
Talking about the Singularity is a paradox, because it is an attempt to 
imagine something that is by definition unimaginable to people in the 
present day. But that hasn’t stopped hundreds of science fiction writers 
and futurists from doing it.
 Where does the term “Singularity” come from?
Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge popularized the idea of the Singularity 
in his 1993 essay “Technological Singularity.” There he described the 
Singularity this way:
It is a point where our old models must be discarded and a 
new reality rules. As we move closer to this point, it will loom 
vaster and vaster over human affairs till the notion becomes a 
commonplace. Yet when it finally happens it may still be a great 
surprise and a greater unknown.
Specifically, Vinge pinned the Singularity to the emergence of artificial 
intelligence. “We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of 
human life on Earth,” he wrote. “The precise cause of this change is the 
imminent creation by technology of entities with greater than human 
intelligence.”
Author Ken MacLeod has a character describe the Singularity as “the 
2.4 Gray Goo. According to the gray 
goo scenario, self-replicating robots 
exponentially multiply and eventually 
consume the entire planet. Artwork 
created by Giacomo Costa.
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : What is the Singularity? 81
Rapture for nerds” in his novel The Cassini Division, and the turn of 
phrase stuck, becoming a popular way to describe the Singularity. (Note: 
MacLeod didn’t actually coin this phrase - he says he got the phrase from 
a satirical essay in an early-1990s issue of Extropy.) Catherynne Valente 
argued recently for an expansion of the term to include what she calls 
“personal singularities,” moments where a person is altered so much that 
she becomes unrecognizable to her former self. This definition could 
include posthuman experiences.
 What technologies are likely to cause the next Singularity?
As we mentioned earlier, artificial intelligence is the technology that 
most people believe will usher in the Singularity. Authors like Vinge 
and singulatarian Ray Kurzweil think AI will usher in the Singularity 
for a twofold reason. First, creating a new form of intelligent life will 
completely change our understanding of ourselves as humans. Second, AI 
will allow us to develop new technologies so much faster than we could 
before that our civilization will transform rapidly. A corollary to AI is the 
development of robots who can work alongside - and beyond - humans.
Another Singularity technology is the self-replicating molecular machine, 
also called autonomous nanobots, “gray goo,” and a host of other things. 
Basically the idea is that if we can build machines that manipulate matter 
at the atomic level, we can control our world in the most granular way 
imaginable. And if these machines can work on their own? Who knows 
what will happen. For a dark vision of this Singularity, see Greg Bear’s 
novel Blood Music or Bill Joy’s essay “The Future Doesn’t Need Us”; for a 
more optimistic vision, Rudy Rucker’s Postsingular.
And finally, a lot of singulatarian thought is devoted to the idea that 
synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and other life sciences will 
eventually give us control of the human genome. Two world-altering 
events would come out of that. One, we could engineer new forms of 
life and change the course of human evolution in one generation. Two, 
it’s likely that control over our genomes will allow us to tinker with the 
mechanisms that make us age, thus dramatically increasing our lifespans. 
Many futurists, from Kurzweil and Steward Brand, to scientists like 
Aubrey De Gray, have suggested that extreme human longevity (in the 
hundreds of years) is a crucial part of the Singularity.
Have we had a Singularity before?
The Singularity is usually anticipated as a future transformation, but it can 
also be used to describe past transformations like the one in our example 
earlier with the person from 1200. The industrial revolution could be said 
to represent a Singularity, as could the information age.
When will the Singularity happen?
In 1992, Vinge predicted that “in 30 years” we would have artificial 
intelligence. We’ve still got 12 years to go - it could happen! In his 
groundbreaking 2000 essay for Wired, “The Future Doesn’t Need 
2.5 A novel with one foot in the future. 
In the book Rainbow’s End, Vernor Vinge 
imagines what our world might look like 
in 2025. The author dedicated his book to 
“the Internet-based cognitive tools that 
are changing our lives—Wikipedia, Google 
and the others of their kind, now and in 
the future.”
82 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : What is the Singularity?
Us,”technologist Joy opined:
The enabling breakthrough to assemblers seems quite likely within 
the next 20 years. Molecular electronics - the new subfield of 
nanotechnology where individual molecules are circuit elements 
- should mature quickly and become enormously lucrative 
within this decade, causing a large incremental investment in all 
nanotechnologies.
And in the 2005 book The Singularity Is Near, Ray Kurzweil says the 
Singularity will come “within several decades.”
Longevity scientist De Gray says that our biotech is advanced enough 
that a child born in 2010 might live to be 150, or 500 years old. MIT AI 
researcher Rodney Brooks writes in his excellent book Flesh and Machines 
that it’s “unlikely that we will be able to simply download our brains into 
a computer anytime soon.” Though Brooks does add:
The lives of our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will be as 
unrecognizable to us as our use of information technology in all 
its forms would be incomprehensible to someone from the dawn 
of the twentieth century.
So when will the Singularity really happen? It depends on your 
perspective. But it always seem like it’s just a few decades off.

84 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Best-case scenarios
R. U. SIRIUS
“The best-case scenario for posthumanity.” 
A few months after he visited Trinity University, guest speaker R. U. Sirius 
authored this thought provoking analysis of a positive posthuman future. As 
Annalee Newitz notes in the preface to his piece, “futurist writer R.U. Sirius 
helped create Mondo 2000, runs posthumanist magazine H+, and has run 
for president. He was cyber before it was cool, and is still fomenting techno 
revolution.”
Annalee has asked me to comment on what is the best-case scenario for 
posthumanity and what groups are working on putting that scenario in 
motion. This is the sort of question that invites utopian musings. I’ve 
become somewhat shy of utopian projections, which is maybe why I tend 
to interview other people and let them take the fall… but what the hell, 
I’ll give it a shot.
The fun, of course, would be in visions of tall, thin, beautiful blue skinned 
beings that are super bright rather than corny (Maybe winged, too. 
Winged would be nice.), a third arm for carrying groceries, skinny little 
fingers for ever-tinier portable devices, and everybody engineered at the 
germ line to be crazy sex freaks.
But being of nobler stuff, I’ll give you what I think is the best down 
to earth scenario for near-term enhanced humanity, and then I’ll also 
mention a few further out visions—some of which I’m fond of.
Here’s what I see when I’m wearing my optimist’s hat. The emergent 
property of a technologically networked culture is voluntary collaboration 
and sharing. It may seem distant now, but things can change fast (Berlin 
Wall), and I think it’s reasonably likely that some time in the next 10 to 
40 years, the main way most people will engage in productive or creative 
or playful (or all of the above) activities—and the main way that value 
will be shared or exchanged—will be through open source, voluntary, 
collaborationist networks that also use some variation of p2p to make 
whatever available to whomever.
So here’s what happens when we add in the idealistic tech scenario. We get 
basic control over the structure of matter—nanotechnology as production 
technology. Matter becomes information that can be shared p2p. It’s 
tied to desktop manufacturing. You go online, pick up the code for what 
you want and “print” it. Even if there are still some people who aren’t 
that resourced, there are plenty of people who want to distribute the free 
stuff to those in need. Who? Your basic generous open sourcers… your 
left libertarian types, definitely… but hell, even Nicholas Negroponte 
wants one laptop per child. Well, one desktop unit per person shouldn’t 
be too difficult under these conditions. In essence, within a decade or 
less of production nanotechnology, there is no resource scarcity, with the 
exception of physical space, and no distribution problem.
We also get as much control over biology as is possible, so there are few 
if any diseases, aging is slowed down stopped or reversed, replacement 
2.7 Outlaw biology? Public participation 
in the age of big bio. Organized by 
Christopher Kelty in 2010, the Outlaw 
Biology symposium is an excellent example 
of what Sirius terms “the activity 
oriented, participatory DIY culture that 
has been evolving since the Whole Earth 
Review… since punk… since the early 
hackers… since Make magazine… since open 
source biotech (ad infinitum).”
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Best-case scenarios 85
body parts are grown, skin color is self-selecting, we can eventually begin 
to program desirable traits in and out of humans by engineering—both 
interventions in the already born and at the germ line… ad infinitum.
The more optimistic AI projections pan out. We have smarter-than human systems resolving our technical and possibly our political problems 
before they happen – it’s largely about pattern recognition, after all. We 
also take the intelligence inside us so that we have all the information and 
intelligence in the human/cyborg system accessible behind our eyes. Add 
to that technologies and substances for neural self control -intelligence, 
moods, creative flow, ecstasies and visions that are accessible to our raw 
brains with little or no downside.
So people are feeling pretty good, and they’re long-lived, smart, bodily 
modified if desired both internally and externally and there’s no 
more coerced work/wage slavery. And thanks to the activity oriented, 
participatory DIY culture that has been evolving since the Whole Earth 
Review… since punk… since the early hackers… since Make magazine… 
since open source biotech (ad infinitum), most people don’t become 
passive bliss ninnies (and even if most of them do, there is still a minority 
in the billions made up of active people to keep things interesting and 
expanding.) Work is play (Gamification). And we’re not boring… we 
still have an edge. There are still unforeseen challenges. Also, advanced 
virtuality provides a safe zone for the most extreme types of acting out.
Of course, the real world is never this smooth. And there are always some 
skunks at the garden party (and most utopias, being totalitarian in some 
way, might deserve them.) Out of this truth, a million science fiction 
stories have been born. But the argument can be made—and has been 
made—that what I’ve described is broadly the direction in which things 
will go provided that all or most of these technological advances actually 
occur to the degree suggested (or close enough), and these advances will 
do far more good than harm.
Ok, so who is working towards this eventuality? Well, if it happens this 
way, pretty much everybody in the NBIC fields—everybody working 
on nanotech and biotech and AI and brain science, whether as citizen 
scientists in a collaborationist project or working for a corporation, or 
those wacky surrealists at DARPA—they’re all pushing this potentiality 
forward. Of course, we may have to “hijack the Singularity” from 
them eventually—or even now (think gene patent v. open source bio). 
But mainly, I think all the people who are engaging in open source 
collaborationist tinkering and culture, the citizen scientists—particularly 
the more sophisticated and educated young people that are choosing to 
invest themselves in “garage” projects—I think they all may be taking us 
there.
I also think the best, smartest critics and skeptics and SF writers and 
creators are helping by problematizing these scenarios in advance, by 
giving us arguments and narratives that remind us about human behaviors 
and emotions and political and economic and scientific realities. Brilliant 
fiction adds to our foresight… our pattern recognition… by playing out 
2.8 DNA-based assembly line for precise 
nano-cluster construction. As explained by 
the Brookhaven press release, “scientists 
at the U.S. Department of Energy’s 
(DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory 
have designed a molecular assembly 
line for predictable, high-precision 
nano-construction. Such reliable, 
reproducible nanofabrication is essential 
for exploiting the unique properties 
of nanoparticles in applications such 
as biological sensors and devices for 
converting sunlight to electricity.”

size. Image source: Brookhaven National

dramatic, difficult, dark, challenging, ambiguous or dystopian scenarios 
based on similar technological possibilities.
So that’s sort of a simple bottom line upbeat vision of posthumanity, 
without anything so far out as Kurzweil’s vision of imposing our idea 
of intelligence on the entire galaxy and all creatures within; or Leary’s 
1970s vision of spacefaring posthuman intelligence-amplified and 
immortal psychedelic gods heading home to “Galactic Central” after 
fully conquering the quantum realm; or David Pearce’s marvelous vision 
in the Hedonistic Imperative (look it up) of a post-Darwinian humanity 
engineered at the germ line to spend their lives at various gradations of 
functional ecstasy while abolishing suffering among all sentient beings.
As I said at the start of this, Annalee’s question invited these utopian 
musings, and it would require another essay of equal length to express all 
my doubts and ambiguities. But I’m sure the inevitable comments will 
take care of that. I know I can count on you.

reflections
88 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Reflections on the transhuman movement
Transhumanism. The name sounds futuristic and slightly ridiculous, 
but the ideas behind it are more realistic than one might expect. 
Transhumanism is an “international intellectual and cultural movement 
supporting the use of science and technology to improve human mental 
and physical characteristics and capacities.” Basically, it’s humans using 
science to change humans with the idea of bettering the species in general.
This is a broad idea and there are several categories of transhumanism 
that one might look into. Timothy Leary wrote about space migration, 
saying that the future is found in the movement of humans into space to 
colonize other planets. He believed that the only way for our species to 
survive is to keep expanding—off the planet—and to spread into other 
solar systems or galaxies. 
Annalee Newitz, on the other hand, is into biohacking. This involves 
editing (modifying) a human being’s physical structure, again with the 
goal of improving it. “Improving,” by the way, could mean anything.
Adding a tail to one’s rear may be desired by a few people; to them, 
it’s an improvement! Biohacking isn’t just DNA editing to change us 
up. It can also include adding cyborg-like machines to our bodies (I, 
Robot, anybody?) or taking drugs that help us work better (who wants to 
be the Hulk?). 
Is it plausible that these goals could be achieved in my lifetime? Of course 
they can. This question seems absurd when you factor in Singularity 
theories about how fast technology advances these days. We’re already 
testing life extension drugs. We’re making breakthroughs in genetic 
sequencing; who knows where that will lead? We’re even making 
computers that can read our minds. What’s next? 
There are already forces that might limit the progress of transhumanism. 
Ahoy, religion! Anyone who reads or watches science fiction (or history) 
knows that religion always opposes change. Tampering with “God’s 
image” is sure to be a big issue. And you know that politicians will just eat 
that up and limit progress for years on end. Gotta love it. 
I’m gonna be honest and admit that I experience many emotions when I 
consider what the future could hold for myself and humanity in general. 
Transhumanism might as well be a religion to me with the amount of awe 
it inspires. 
After learning about what this movement stands for and is trying to 
accomplish, I would have to say that the goals are inevitable in some 
distant future. People will figure out how to make changes to humans and 
people will want them. It’s that simple! At the same time... if we make 
space colonies then who won’t want to go to Mars after re-watching Total 
Recall a good nine times? The future is being dreamed up now, and with 
our increasing pace of technological advancement, that dream is turning 
into a reality faster than we think.

MARICELA RIOS
“Thoughts on transcending the human race”
The objective of transhumanism is to improve the characteristics of the 
human race by the use of advanced science and technology. Literally, to 
be a transhumanist would be to transcend above and beyond the average 
human being. Transhumanism is something that essentially means the 
distinct line which once separated humans from technology, has been 
blurred. The coexistence of people and science will, through evolution, 
begin to fuse together. 
The ideas regarding human enhancement in Timothy Leary’s article 
are beyond anything that I ever imagined possible. I don’t see mankind 
abandoning earth and migrating to space anytime soon. But, perhaps I 
under estimate the capabilities of the near future. He details what post human life will be like after space migration and predicts different worlds 
forming for particular groups of people (e.g., bisexual vegetarians, Hell’s 
Angels, etc.) where they can be themselves and not clash with others. 
This concept confuses me. 
Who will govern these different worlds? Who will help control a society in 
space? Who will set the line for science and technology which we do not 
cross? 
There has to be a place where these advanced beings can go and find 
simple earth qualities reminding them that they are, in fact, still human. 
These questions are floating in my brain but they can be answered with 
time and intelligence increase working hand-in-hand. The concept of 
increased intelligence doesn’t startle me in the way space migration does 
because of the human evolution that has already occurred. My only worry 
is regarding the negative effects of human beings losing simplicity. 
In a nut-shell, I suppose my feelings towards the ideas of enhancing 
human life are hopeful and excited with a dash of skepticism. The idea of 
a world with basically no limitations is fascinating and worries me at the 
same time. Maybe if my intelligence enhances I will feel differently about 
these ideas.

90 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Reflections on the transhuman movement
From what I have come to understand of the Transhumanist movement, 
its primary objective is nothing less than the complete liberation of the 
human race from its biological constraints through technology. It is an 
ideal that looks toward biotechnologies and other emergent technologies 
as potential catalysts for human enhancement that could eventually lead 
to a Technological Singularity. 
This Technological Singularity is a point in time in which technology 
would allow humanity to finally transcend the limitations of organic 
life such as age, disease or even death and achieve almost limitless 
advancements in intellect and civilization. In short, it is perhaps the next 
step in the evolutionary history of our species. 
Given the current rate of humanity’s technological expansion, it is 
not completely unrealistic to guess that the Technological Singularity 
could happen sometime in the near future. However, such insubstantial 
speculations on the future accommodate a number of wild assumptions 
and are ultimately futile. The “future” holds an infinite number of 
possibilities and trying to guess which course it will take is absolutely 
impossible. If it does happen in the near future then good for us. If it 
doesn’t happen, humanity has the rest of eternity to reach it assuming we 
don’t wipe each other out first.
There is a wide array of ethical concerns in regard to the Transhumanism 
movement, ranging from religious and social issues to political problems. 
One such claim against Transhumanism involves the religious/secular 
hubris argument in which the attempt to modify the human body to gain 
godlike power is seen as a spiritual affront to a real god as an unacceptable 
risk to artificially guide the course of human evolution considering that 
we are products of predominantly biological functions. 
Another argument is the possibility of eugenics wars wrought from 
notions of genetic/technological superiority between countries or even 
individuals that could ultimately lead to massive genocide campaigns to 
cleanse the genetic pool. 
Finally, there is the perceived threat of dehumanization in which 
genetic engineering and other human enhancement technologies could 
produce races of genetic slaves or objectified sub-humans that exist to 
serve the master genetic race. There are many more arguments against 
Transhumanism than the three I have just listed but these are the basic 
contentions against it.
As an existentialist I am reluctant to accept any ideals which extol the 
future. Anything that detracts from the present in hope of something 
better in the future is just another way of trying to find meaning 
externally from one’s self that ultimately leads to a dearth in social and 
individual will power.

Why should we strive to better ourselves now when all this technology

Yet, despite my skepticism, I can’t help but feel approval for this 
movement’s monumental predictions. It does seem like the logical 
outcome of all this technology and after all hasn’t our desire for 
immortality been the overwhelming goal of humanity since our species’ 
very beginning.

The concepts behind transhumanism appeal to me. Well, for the most 
part. Dr. Leary’s article on space migration sounded like one of his acid 
trips, although he did provide examples of why humans are destined to 
go to the final frontier. However, he included no evidence, which in the 
academic world means he is full of it. From what I gather, the overall 
goal of transhumanism is to enhance human life through the forging of 
technologies with the human body and mind. 
I could argue that we are all transhumanists. I mean look at how much we 
rely on technology for our everyday needs. I bet you anything you do not 
know all the names and their numbers in your phone’s memory. 
Ah, here is the best part: you could potentially argue that your phone’s 
memory is merely an extension of your own mind. If technologies such 
as the personal computer, smart phones, and your whatevers that do 
whatevers, have become such an integral part of your life, why deny that 
they are extensions of yourself?
Marshall McLuhan once said that, “the medium is the message,” and I 
think he was onto something. If we follow his argument, he states that 
different form media, such as television, are extensions of one’s senses and 
perception. This idea can be translated accordingly to transhumanist ideas.
Yet there are some transhuman concepts that I would shy away from, such 
as DNA manipulation. This idea reminds me of the movie Gattaca. We 
often associate eugenics with totalitarian governments that seek to create a 
master race (ahem, the Nazis), but this idea can extend even further. 
What I’m referring to is liberal eugenics. This concept still has the 
basic foundations of eugenics, but manages to make it into a consumer 
commodity. This gives birth to many different problems.
Think about it: if we already have a huge disparity between the rich 
and the poor when comes to access to technology, imagine how liberal 
eugenics heightens this problem. Those who can afford to have their 
DNA modified so they are super fast, super strong, and super intelligent, 
will surpass those who cannot afford to do so. So as a result not onlyare 
the poor people poor, but they are now genetically inferior to their rich 
counterparts.
So when I say I support transhumanism, I can only go so far. I like the 
idea of having an exoskeleton, or a bionic arm, or anything that is an 
addition to my regular non-altered self. But when we decide to mess 
around with things that should not be changed, I find myself coming into 
a grey area. The potential is awesome, but so are the dangers.

“Solving the world’s problems? Or creating more conflict?”
Transhumanism is the application of science and technology to the 
human body in order to improve humans in all aspects of life. This 
includes higher mental capacity, the ability to live as long as you want, 
and ridding the world of diseases. While this appears to create something 
of a “superhuman,” people supporting transhumanism don’t focus on 
individual applications. Rather, transhumanists believe that—if we were 
able to apply all of these “enhancements” to the entire population—our 
world would be rid of poverty, disease, and other problems.
In the world today, enhancing yourself to perform at higher levels than 
those around you is looked down upon in many areas. It is seen as 
cheating in sports and in the classroom. We have to also look at how 
unnatural it would be. Homo sapiens have developed over thousands 
of years, and are continuing to do so. Using something artificial in our 
bodies would not only send this process out of balance, but could possibly 
cause other damage as well. 
On the other hand, using this technology could lead us to new discoveries 
and other amazing things which we would never have found otherwise. 
You could also talk about survival in the context of transhumanism. The 
earth is bound to be encountered with some population threatening 
disaster, and having the mental enhancement to figure out a problem 
would be a necessary reason to have a higher form or intelligence.
I believe that this technology will be made available in our lifetime, 
however, as with any new technology, I think it will be incredibly 
expensive. That brings me back to my point of fairness. Those with the 
available money to spend on this enhancement will be able to, and those 
that can’t, the poor or the middle class, will have nothing to show for it. 
The rich will get richer and smarter because of this, and it simply wouldn’t 
be fair. Intelligence should be made available to all. Starving children can 
read history and English books in Africa, but they wouldn’t be able to 
afford the chip the goes inside your brain to make you smarter.
I personally think it would be awesome to be artificially enhanced. I 
would see the world through brand new eyes and it would be quite an 
experience. I don’t believe it would be fair to everyone, however, that 
wasn’t able to receive this intelligence. Until increased intelligence can be a 
mass produced commodity, I can’t see it gaining much support.

94 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Reflections on the transhuman movement
To me it makes sense that humanity would tend towards a movement 
such as transhumanism. It seems that with everything we do, we’re trying 
to make thing bigger, better, easier, and cooler. Man’s dedication to 
furthering knowledge has brought us so much so quickly that the idea of 
transhumanism and the technological advances that must accompany it 
are next in a line of mankind’s natural progression. To evolve further as a 
species, the use of technology is necessary. I do not, however, believe that 
this is a step to be taken lightly, if taken at all. 
If space migration is ever integrated into general society, the reality 
of a transhumanist society will be imminent. To prolong the lifespan 
of humankind on earth as we are growing at such a rapid rate would 
be a death wish. The planet would over populate, resources would be 
completely depleted, and society would crumble. Even now, the number 
of diseases being cured increases, and our ability to survive through 
sickness is being finely honed. This technology is coming about rapidly, 
and the consequences it will have on society will soon be major. 
Timothy Leary’s ideas for the future are the most appealing. His view of 
space as spurring the creation of new neural circuits through the presence 
of new and intriguing options is a noble one. If this is true, and if by 
leaving the planet we can open our minds more fully, then why not? The 
Earth can be left alone to recuperate from our stay here. Once humans 
have adjusted to the idea of living in space, the planet will be allowed to 
replenish itself as it’s children finally leave home. 
The movement into space will also open up countless jobs. Every space 
habitat being lived on will need have job availabilities. The habitats 
themselves will also have to be built by teams of people. Space itself will 
need to be studied in greater detail in order to know exactly what would 
be necessary to create an appropriate environment to sustain human life 
for an elongated period of time. Then once the space habitats have been 
set up, there will be countless jobs available on each one. Even in ways 
we cannot yet imagine, this could provide a complete bolster for the 
economy. But getting the funding to be able to start the whole process 
may prove to be a hassle.
The transhumanist movement as a whole is a pretty scary idea, but I 
don’t think it’s one that can necessarily be avoided. If the technology is 
out there (which eventually, it will be), people are going to want to use 
it, regardless of the circumstances. Even though many of these ideas are 
dangerous before the exact consequences of their use is known, people are 
willing to take that chance to be able to perceive that they have made their 
life better then it could be otherwise. 
What we need now is an in depth global discussion about what might 
happen, and whether or not taking this next step is worth it. 
Our lives are at stake.

ASHLEY FUNKHOUSER
“A dangerous trap?”
After doing the reading for this week’s class, I have been intrigued by the 
idea of transhumanism. I thought that the interview in h+ Magazine was 
particularly interesting. The interviewer brought up interesting questions 
like, if total happiness were the norm, would pain be a novelty that people 
would seek?
At first, biotechnology really freaked me out. However, the more I think 
about it and get used to it, the less scary it seems. The main problem 
is that by engineering our emotions, we traipse into a very dangerous 
territory of engineering our personalities and our sense of self. There isn’t 
much point to having a life, if it is going to be predetermined for you. 
I’m not sure if I would choose to be happy all the time if I had the choice 
to. Sometimes, the mere fact that I have managed to make myself happy 
is the most rewarding part for me. I strive to make any situation a 
positive one, and when I succeed, it is an even greater feeling than the one 
that I would’ve had if I had simply been happy despite a bad situation. 
If everyone were in a state of absolute euphoria all the time, we might not 
know what a good thing we have going by being happy all the time. Part 
of the amazing thing about euphoria is that it is a rare feeling. It is the 
occasional presence of pain that makes joy so great. Of course, I definitely 
prefer to be in a greater state of happiness most of the time.
Some of the social and political opposition to transhumanism stems 
from these fears. Also, one giant obstacle that transhumanism needs 
to overcome is religion. The transhumanists will face much opposition 
from the religious sector of the world, and they need to find a way to 
accommodate this opposition. Elsewhere, h+ Magazine discusses the 
part of our brain that needs to have religion and the way that a person’s 
particular religion affects the rest of their life. 
Religion will always be an essential component of our biology. Even if 
transhumanists find a way to make us happy, super-intelligent humans all 
the time, religion will continue to be necessary.

96 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Reflections on the transhuman movement
It is interesting to see the different stances that people take on 
transhumanism. To truly grasp the various arguments, one must first 
understand what exactly we are talking about. For this I am going to rely 
on the almost always trustworthy Wikipedia: 
“Transhumanism is an international intellectual and cultural 
movement supporting the use of science and technology 
to improve human mental and physical characteristics and 
capacities.” 
That sounds about right to me, and these improvements can range all the 
way from the far-fetched (like superhuman powers and immortality) to 
the plausible (like curing cancer or making drought resistant crops).
The arguments of authors in the course reading can be broken down like 
this: 
Timothy Leary: S.M.I.L.E. = Space migration, intelligence 
increase and life extension. The first step is breaking out and 
dusting off the technology for humans to migrate into space and 
then you increase their intelligence so they don’t get bored in 
space. This solves the population problem and people can live 
longer.
Duncan: Duncan mostly discusses the use of gene modification 
to increase the quality of human life in outside ways rather than 
actually modifying humans themselves (genetically modified 
crops, curing disease, etc.)
Lynch/Block: These authors focus on neuroscience to end 
suffering. They take a scientific approach and inform the reader 
that further progress requires actually experimenting on humans.
Kent: Kent is a vegan animal rights activist who sees 
transhumanism as a chance to end all pain and suffering. This 
offers a similar effect as ecstasy but with more control.
Newitz: Transhumanism is fine when it comes to body 
modification, but using it to cure disease and creating immortality 
is taking it to far. People don’t need to live forever at this point in 
time.
Each of these authors takes a different approach to the idea of 
transhumanism but they all share a common goal of increasing the quality 
of human life. This a noble goal and in most ways transhumanism seems 
a viable way to achieve this goal. 
I agree most with Newitz and Leary. Extending the lifespan of humans to 
200 or 300 years offers far more problems than benefits. If your rich uncle

never died, you would never inherit his money. 
Say you’ve lived 250 years, what are you going to do with yourself after 
the first hundred? 
If we who are alive today were alive in the 1800s... wouldn’t it have been 
a shock for us to go from no electricity to today? (If you are shaking your 
head no then just think how hard it was for most your grandparents to a 
adapt to computers) 
The biggest problem is the one Leary is trying to solve with his space 
migration theory: where are all these people and their children going to 
live? How are we going to sustain them with the limited resources we 
have? All of these problems need to be solved before we can even think 
about expanding the life span on human beings.
One of the most viable applications of transhumanism today does not 
actually involve changing the human body. Genetically modified crops 
are currently the big thing in the agricultural world and they are truly 
helping solve hunger issues around the world. 
For all of you who are a bit weirded out by the idea of eating genetically 
altered food you have to consider that we have been doing it for centuries. 
Next time you bite into an apple you should know that no matter what 
type it is, it comes from only one genetic parent. How about bananas? 
Consider that every banana in the world comes from only one plant from 
Papa New Guinea that has been transplanted in pieces all around the 
world. 
These are just a few examples, but we have genetically modified the 
majority of foods we eat through simple breeding practices. Now, we have 
simply reached the point that we can start at the genetic level in a lab and 
control things more actively. Companies have produced drought resistant 
and pest resistant crops that are being grown all over the world. Things 
can go wrong but you have to weight the benefits against the chance of 
catastrophic failure. 
For those interested in these ideas, I recommend the book The Doomsday 
Key by James Rollins. It’s great fiction with a amazing scientific base where 
the plot revolves around genetically modified crops.
There are many costs and benefits to all elements of transhumanism but 
it will be at the forefront of the next technology boom. The only thing 
that we can do about it is try to keep it in check while rolling with the 
punches. 
We stand on the precipice of changing life as we know it using existing 
technology. But we need to use these ideas to fix the problems we are 
currently facing before we do something like “cure death” and thereby 
open up a whole new set of problems.
Let’s just take this one step at a time.

98 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Reflections on the transhuman movement
Much of this course has dealt with the theme of transhumanism, which 
is loosely defined as the societal drive to enhance our minds and bodies 
through new applications of technology. Whether it’s the use of nano scale robots in our bloodstream, the invention of robotic body parts that 
will turn us into cyborgs, or just the optimization of mind-enhancing 
substances for the achievement of maximum productivity and/or 
recreational enjoyment, the multivariate ways in which transhumanists 
predict our lives will be altered by technology is astounding.
One of the speakers from this course was a man named R.U. Sirius, who 
edits h+ Magazine. ‘H+’ is the symbol for the tranhumanist movement, 
short for “humanity plus”. As part of this class, we were told to peruse 
the magazine and write about things we found interesting. Well, in the 
course of my browsing, I was fascinated by an article titled “The Genomic 
Bodhisattva,” an interview with David Pearce, author of The Hedonistic 
Imperative.
Pearce believes that through intelligent use of technology, we can 
effectively end suffering, and then improve the human condition to such 
an extent that baseline levels of happiness to future human beings far 
exceed the imagined possibilities of today. The two technical mechanisms 
he focuses on are pharmacology and gene-therapy. One phrase Pearce likes 
to use is that technology can give us the ability to “recalibrate our hedonic 
treadmill,” which refers to the idea that people tend to stay at a “relatively 
stable level of happiness, despite changes in fortune or the achievement of 
major goals.”
That idea reminded me of a recent TED talk by behavioral economist 
Daniel Kahneman, about the way we perceive happiness differently 
through experience and memory. One of Kahneman’s key points is the 
idea that our idea of happiness in any moment is different from what 
causes us to remember events as having been good times. I think what 
Pearce is most trying to optimize is our experiential happiness, though he 
recognizes that the complex interplay of dopamine, serotonin, and other 
chemicals in the brain makes this a delicate operation. For a full rundown 
of Pearce’s ideas, I urge you to check out his site. 
One of the first things to realize—according to Pearce—is that our brains 
are not designed to make us happy. All of our inborn urges and drives, 
pleasurable and painful tendencies, even our abilities to feel happy and 
sad, exist because they help our genes to propagate. As Pearce puts it: 
Blind selective pressures have acted on living organisms over hundreds 
of millions of years. Darwinian evolution has powerfully favoured the 
growth of ever more diverse, excruciating, but also more adaptive varieties 
of psychophysical pain.
Just the realization that we have no fundamental need to be happy is a 
game changer. If you look at recurring human behaviors that cause so

Kent’s interview with David Pearce can 
be found in the Fall 2009 edition of h+ 
Magazine (p. 58). In the introduction to 
his web site The Hedonistic Imperative, 
Pearce argues that “genetic engineering 
and nanotechnology will abolish suffering 
in all sentient life.” According to Pearce, 
“the abolitionist project is hugely 
ambitious but technically feasible. It is 
also instrumentally rational and morally 
urgent.”
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Reflections on the transhuman movement 99
much pain and sadness, you might be baffled if you expected that humans 
were designed to rationally seek out happiness. This just isn’t the case.
In an effort to enhance our ability to feel happiness, Pearce advocates 
the modification of human germline cells. The germline refers to genetic 
material that may be passed on to offspring, in contrast to somatic cells. 
The first thing that we need to do is “sabotage a small but vicious set of 
negative feedback mechanisms,” which are genetically coded into the 
mind and brain. He argues that today’s recreational drugs, “quick and 
dirty euphoriants,” don’t transcend these mechanisms, but they do offer 
an intriguing glimpse into what human life could be like if our underlying 
brain architecture were well modified. 
Though I haven’t tried many of the euphoriants Pearce refers to, I 
recognize a gross lack of open-minded discussion about the effects 
of substances on our minds, especially—unfortunately—on the part 
government officials, notably the DEA. In February 2010, in Missouri, 
a group of fully armed paramilitary law enforcement officers broke into 
a home after dark and shoot the family dog in front of a small child—all 
because of a misdemeanor drug warrant. Clearly, something is horribly 
wrong with our nation’s drug policy. (See: Radley Balko, “Video of swat 
raid on Missouri family” in Reason Magazine, May 5, 2010).
On the other end of the spectrum, it’s important to note that irresponsible 
use of substances can cause tremendous problems, as in the case of a 
drug user who castrated himself because he feared his testicles contained 
“monsters.” (See: “Tripper amputates, flushes monster-containing 
testicles” in The Arcata Eye, May 12, 2010). 
Whether irresponsible idiots like this warrant the existence of our current 
enforcement mechanisms is hard to say, though I tend to veer on the side 
of a drastically limited government that stays out of people’s way until 
they present a threat to others. I distrust anyone who thinks it’s a good 
idea to legislate away personal freedoms.
Returning to the subject of gene-therapy, I think it’s interesting and 
encouraging to think about the kind of transformations that could take 
place if notions of Darwinian selection were replaced or altered with 
some form of intentionality. I wonder about the relative effectiveness 
of emergent versus top-down design, and whether this kind of program 
will be accepted within the moral standards of a Darwinian society, but I 
think it’s encouraging that we have people devoting so much energy to the 
abolition of suffering and the transcendence of human limitation.

First off, I think it’s awesome that R. U. Sirius is the editor in chief of h+. 
It makes total sense.
h+ Magazine is just—it’s awesome. There’s no other word for it. For 
starters, it’s got Dollhouse on the cover. Win. Instant points. The graphics 
are great, the layout is intriguing and different, and the content could 
occupy me for hours. The topics are super intelligent but they’re explained 
in a way that any fairly intelligent person with no prior transhumanism 
knowledge could understand.
Transhumanism doesn’t seem to be anything that ends or that we can 
ever ultimately achieve. The point of transhumanism is to keep pushing 
the boundaries of what we as humans are capable of doing, making, or 
imagining. Its objectives are twofold. 
The first objective of transhumanism is to broaden mainstream views 
and beliefs about what it means to be human. In the editor’s corner on 
page 10, Sirius talks about the “beginnings” of transhumanism with the 
emergence of transgender people. I had no idea that transgender surgeries 
and hormonal treatments began shortly after World War II. As Sirius 
(bahaha... Sirius Black... come on they even look the same) points out, this 
idea of transgender people isn’t such a big deal to us now, over fifty years 
later: “Now, a woman-to-man gives birth to a baby and most of us barely 
bat an eye.” 
Transhumanism aims to protect the civil rights of transhumanists such as 
transgendered people. Sirius mentions that there is still “bigotry and a lack 
of legal protections” and he seems to say this with disappointment and 
some bitterness. Transhumanism aims to make these ideas mainstream so 
they are accepted and so people who are transhumanists—but who are 
first and foremost HUMANS just like you and me and everyone else—are 
accepted for who they are or who they want to become. Because really, 
who are we to judge?
The second objective of transhumanism is to explore how technology can 
help us change our definitions of how to be human. Our achievements are 
possible because of technology, and our self-worth as a species is defined 
by technology. As humans, we’re defined not by what we can physically 
do (like make fire or build bigger buildings) but by the technologies 
we build. Of course, these technologies will probably help us do other 
things physically. Some of the articles that explore this are “Can Robots 
Feel Joy?” or “Enhanced: My New Sense Organ” or “Transgender, 
Transhuman, Transbeing.”
In terms of ethical concerns, transhumanists are going to push the 
envelope no matter what. In the “Editor’s Corner,” Sirius mentions 
the idea of changing skin melanin to be trans-racial. “The Transgender, 
Transhuman, Transbeing” article raises similar ethical concerns over 
whether or not it’s ethical to download people into computers.

This all seems like science fiction almost but the fact is that it is happening 
and it is happening now. Sometimes I feel like I’m complacent where I 
am right now as if everything is going to stay exactly the same way as it is. 
Nothing could possibly get any more advanced. Maybe a few things here 
and there, but as far as big things go? Nah. We’re set.
False. Big things are happening and h+ and transhumanists are bring these 
ideas into the mainstream culture. In the last 20 years, the Internet has 
taken over the world, changed the face of all interactions, and created a 
new lifestyle. 
So what’s going to happen in the next 20 years? We will be in our 40s. 
What are our kids going to grow up thinking is normal? Are ideas that h+
brings up possible? I think so. And it’s kind of terrifying. Robots that feel 
emotions? (CYLONS?! WHAT?!) Uploading our minds to a computer? 
But the thing is, during our lifetimes, these kind of things are going to 
become normal.
My gut feeling is a strong mix of “that is so freaking cool” with “that is 
so freaking scary.” What if I become one of those old people who hates 
technology because I don’t know how to work it? Those people are 
annoying. I don’t wanna be them. 
And isn’t this the stuff of science-fiction movies? Really cool technology 
seems awesome and cool and everyone loves it until suddenly it’s a 
disaster. Exhibit A: Battlestar Galactica. Exhibit B: Dollhouse. The list goes 
on and on. So my gut feelings are mixed. It’s awesome in theory and I 
have no doubt that some (if not all) of this stuff is going to become reality, 
but my general feelings are proceed with caution.
Except I still don’t think we’re going to move to space. Sorry Leary. 
I’m going to end with a final quote from RU Sirius that really struck me. 
He’s very good with words, I’m really, really looking forward to his lecture. 
Also, it makes me feel like I’m at Hogwarts.
“As we move into an age of shifting identities, where we can be 
whatever or whoever we choose to be in our second lives; where

body ornamentations and eventually parts, as we learn how to 
control our hormones to amp up our estrogen or testosterone to 
suit the needs of the day, we should always remember to thank the 
transgendered. They have walked point for our basic right to self alter.”

102 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Mind of a pig
EKATERINA SEDIA
“Mind of a pig” 
A first shock of Joel’s life came when he saw a mirror for the first time. 
That elaborate affair of glass and wood was delivered to decorate Cassie’s 
room, and Joel approached it to investigate. He had not given much 
thought to his appearance, but assumed without ever considering that 
he looked like the people around him. He was conscious of some slight 
differences between himself and others, such as he walked on four legs, 
and did not speak. Still, he did not expect his reflection to be quite so 
grotesque.
He twitched his snout, discomfited, and the creature in the mirror did the 
same. A real snout with a flat fleshy circle surrounding his nostrils. Joel 
surveyed slack ears, nothing at all like Cassie’s, the small eyes hiding in the 
folds of fat, a long corpulent body supported by four stubby hoofed legs, 
and a comma of a tail. Joel had seen enough picture books to recognize 
the image. A pig.
He turned his back to the mirror and trotted away, his cloven hooves 
clacking on the hardwood floors of his home. He moved his legs carefully, 
afraid that an abrupt movement would shatter his heart, already aching as 
if from a blow.
Joel pushed a door open with his forehead and lay in the straw bed of his 
pen. The pen took up most of the open porch of a great, old house, and 
Joel had a view of flowerbeds, bursting forth with blue of irises and red 
and black of tulips, and a vast green lawn. He needed to think.
His discovery, as unsettling as it was, explained much. He now knew why 
Cassie and her father talked about him as if he were not there, and why 
newspapers were often snatched from under his nose. Most importantly, 
he realized why Cassie never acknowledged small signs of affection he 
offered. At least, it wasn’t about his personality. It was about him being a 
pig.
His ears pricked up, and he raised his snout to inhale the smell of gas 
and hot metal. Cassie’s Dad came home. Normally, Joel was not very 
interested in the old man – he seemed more of an aged barnacle appended 
to Cassie’s loveliness than a being in his own right. This time, Joel 
watched him.
Cassie’s Dad heaved his old body up the steps with the help of his cane, 
and spoke addressing a young man with a tape recorder in hand, who 
followed close behind. “I hope the tour of the farm assuaged some of your 
and your readers’ concerns. As you could see, it’s a perfectly scientific and 
humane operation.”
“Yes.” The young man stopped and cocked his head. “But did you have 
any issues with patients being squeamish about their transplants? About 
these organs being grown in pigs?”

The old man rasped a laugh. “You have to understand that people who 
need a transplant do not have the luxury of being squeamish. And think 
of the alternatives – would you rather receive a liver extracted from a 
human corpse?”
The young man made a small non-committal sound and looked away.
“You’re too young to remember it, but back in the day… ” Cassie’s Dad 
looked over the flowerbeds, his fingers tapping on the railing of the porch. 
“There was a lot of controversy over human cloning – human rights 
activists feared that people will be cloned only to harvest their organs. 
That never happened, of course – it is much easier to grow human organs 
in pigs, and there’s a whole lot fewer ethical questions. Animal Righters, 
of course, made a fuss, but they always do. Most of them don’t even know 
what they believe in.”
“Why pigs?”
“They are similar to us.” The old man smiled, and snapped his fingers at 
Joel. “Joel, come here, boy.”
Joel trotted up, obedient, hoping that his dark unease did not reflect on 
his face.
“Joel, here,” the old man said, “is a miracle pig. He has a human brain 
– he’s the only one of his kind. A real innovation. Hope your paper will 
enjoy this little factoid.”
The young man rubbed his face. “A brain? Forgive me, Dr. Kernicke, but 
a brain transplant reeks of a bad joke. Why would you need a brain?”
Cassie’s Dad rolled his eyes, and petted Joel’s sagging head. “Not a whole 
one. But you know that people suffer injuries, or – God forbid! – tumors. 
Wouldn’t it be nice to have a replacement frontal lobe in case you lost 
one?”
The young man nodded. “I suppose. But what about personality?”
Cassie’s Dad shook his head, impatient. “What personality? He’s a pig. 
He’s just keeping this brain warm, in a manner of speaking. It’s a blank 
slate. A person who receives Joel’s frontal lobe will eventually develop 
connections between his brain and the transplant, and gradually claim 
it as his own, regaining function as the time goes by. Brain tissue is just 
tissue until a human mind shapes it into something grander.”
The young man turned off his tape recorder. “Doctor,” he said in a hushed 
voice, and gave Joel a sideways look. “How do you know that this pig is 
not sentient?”
“Because pigs did not evolve with this brain!” Cassie’s Dad struck the 
boards of the porch with his cane for emphasis. “It’s like sewing albatross’ 
wings on a pigeon – it won’t make him a better flyer, and chances are that

he won’t fly at all. Every animal is made by evolution, and all parts should 
fit together to function. Joel’s DNA says that he’s a pig, and thus he will 
remain a pig forever, whether we furnish him with a different brain or 
not. He has no other human equipment, such as neurotransmitters and 
sensory system, and thus he cannot make use of the brain. Interview is 
over.”
The young man ran down the steps, traipsed across the lawn, and 
disappeared behind the bend of the driveway. A part of Joel wanted to 
run after the man, to seek his help, while the rest of his soul reeled, as if 
an abyss had opened in front of his hooves. Betrayed by the very people 
who took care of him and pretended to love him – surely, Joseph did not 
feel worse after being sold to Egypt! If Joel could speak, he would’ve called 
anathema upon the old man’s aging, balding head. If he could cry, bloody 
tears would have stained his face. Joel did the only thing he could do. He 
ran.
The gravel of the driveway exploded from under his hooves in small, angry 
fountains, and the greenery of the hedge melted into a green smudge. He 
careened around the turn, just in time to see the young man’s car exhale a 
pungent cloud of exhaust and disappear behind the gate.
Joel’s heart pumped harder than ever as he kept running. The metal bars 
of the gate came into motion, sliding, silent, smell of grease and black 
metal radiating from them. Through the opening, Joel could see a grey 
snake of the road, he could hear honking of the cars, he could smell an 
unfamiliar world that he had previously seen through the gate but never 
entered.
Until now. Joel’s face thrust into the street, into the warm shimmering 
air filled with asphalt fumes, just as the gate slid into his flank. He could 
feel the pain of bruised flesh, followed with a jolt the likes of which he 
had never felt. Every muscle twitched with the searing shock that radiated 
from the metal grid of the gate. Then, it ceased. Joel planted his front 
hooves in the pallid grass that separated the gates from the sidewalk, and 
pulled. The pain renewed – another jolt, then another pause. Joel thought 
that he could smell burnt hair, but it seemed too inconsequential in the 
face of the necessity to free himself. He pulled and strained, until the next 
shock set his flank afire, radiating across his back and down every nerve. 
Joel looked outside, at the traffic that flowed by, oblivious to a pig stuck in 
the gates. The next shock exploded in his eyes, in a shower of white stars, 
and Joel saw no more.
* * * *
Joel woke up in hell. Before he even opened his eyes, he realized that he 
was paralyzed. He sent his muscles a signal to move, to close his mouth, 
but they would not obey. His throat and tongue felt dry as felt, and he 
could not swallow. His ears hurt.
Joel opened his eyes. The white light sliced across his retinas like a knife,

and he squeezed his eyelids shut. Cautiously peering into the whiteness 
through his sparse eyelashes, Joel discerned the shapes of people around 
him. They were dressed in white, and blended with the white walls, the 
instruments in their hands the same color as the chrome fixtures. The 
chrome fixtures that held his mouth open, thrust into his throat far 
enough to scratch it and make him want to gag. Steel shafts penetrated his 
ears, holding his head immobile.
This is it, Joel thought. They’ve found someone who wants my brain 
– wants me. He swiveled his eyes around, half-expecting to see the 
perpetrator. He imagined him reaching greedily for Joel, an unholy gleam 
in his eyes.
Cassie’s Dad came into Joel’s field of vision, moving his face closer. “You 
gave us quite a scare, Joel,” he said. “What were you doing, getting stuck 
in the gate? Did you want to get out?”
Joel would’ve nodded if the mechanical gear did not prevent him.
“Silly boy,” the old man cawed. “You got quite an electric shock, you 
did. Now, you just relax, and we’ll make sure that you did not damage 
anything.”
Despite his discomfort, Joel breathed easier. It wasn’t the time, then. If he 
was lucky, the time would never come. With all his heart he hoped that 
the old man would find something wrong. Some imperfection that would 
let Joel live.
The old man gave a signal, and his helpers, white-gowned people with 
their faces hidden behind white cloths, wheeled Joel’s table into a large, 
humming tunnel. Joel closed his eyes, and in his mind repeated the words 
he heard Cassie whisper before going to sleep. “Please Lord, have mercy 
on us all.” He thought a bit, and added, “Especially Joel.”
Lord did not listen – perhaps, because Joel was a pig, and not a young 
girl with curly hair and eyes like blackberries. After an eternity of loud 
humming and beams of light that shot at him from different angles, 
Cassie’s Dad wheeled Joel out of the tunnel, and patted his snout. “Good 
as new. Good boy.”
Joel wept silently as the masked people unstrapped him and freed his 
mouth from the ravages of steel. He was too wrapped up in his misery to 
look around as Cassie’s Dad nudged him outside of the low stone building 
into the yard covered in asphalt. The old man opened the door of his car, 
and Joel climbed onto a back seat. He looked out of the window, but 
nothing shook him out of the stupor – neither the flowering cherry trees, 
nor people milling about, nor the low wooden pens. He watched a row of 
pigs’ faces pressed against the bars. He guessed that they housed human 
livers, hearts and kidneys. But not minds, Joel thought bitterly. That cross 
was his to bear.
Since that day, Joel thought of ways to escape. He circled the perimeter of

the yard surrounded by thin wires. But the wires gave him the same jolt 
as the gates. He tried to root under the fence, and made good progress, 
but was discovered. The old man moved Joel’s bed into the shed, where he 
could be locked. His only solace was Cassie, who visited him occasionally. 
The old man tagged along on such visits, short and awkward as they were.
“What’s got into him?” the old man said, looking at Joel with 
consternation. He stood in the doorway, the afternoon sun creating a halo 
around his misshapen, hunched silhouette.
Cassie crouched down and patted Joel’s head. “Perhaps he knows.” She 
looked up at her father, her eyes rounded with emphasis.
“Nonsense,” the old man said.
Joel’s heart leapt with hope. He grunted and rubbed against Cassie’s knees, 
almost knocking her over.
“Dad,” she said.
The old man sighed. “There’s nothing I can do,” he said. “It’s not just 
my project. Perhaps it was a bad idea to keep him as a pet – I should’ve 
known that you’d get attached.”
Cassie stood. “What do you mean? Did you find someone?”
The old man nodded. “Ever since it’s been in the papers, we’ve been 
flooded with mail and phone calls. The Congress got involved, and the 
FDA is pushing for clinical trials. I think we found a recipient.”
“Who?”
“A young man,” Cassie’s Dad said. “He was in a car accident some years 
back, suffered a loss of a large portion of the right hemisphere. Think of 
it, Cassie – Joel will help someone to live a normal life. Think how you 
would feel if you were half a person.”
Cassie heaved a sigh, and thrust her hands deep into her jeans pockets. “I 
guess. I would hate to lose Joel though.”
The old man smiled. “You don’t have to lose him, dear. He’ll retain most 
of his brain – more than enough for a pet.”
Joel could not sleep all night. Cassie was an ally. If only he could send her 
a sign, let her know somehow that he was just like her, that he could think 
and understand everything… A sudden thought struck him. He almost 
laughed in disbelief – it was so simple. Why didn’t he think of it before? 
He picked up a twig with his mouth, and started drawing letters in the 
dust. Letters that he remembered since Cassie and he were both carefree 
and young, when she learned the symbols on the bright painted cubes. 
Joel was there, and he had learned too.

It was a hard going – the letters came out shaky and clumsy, and he had 
to start over a few times. He wanted them to be perfect, so that no one 
would doubt his abilities. He labored all night, often stopping to shake 
the salty drops of sweat from his eyes. By the morning, the inscription was 
ready. Large, blocky letters stood out clearly against the grey dirt. “Cassie,” 
he wrote, “I love you.” She would come in the morning and see that he 
had both a heart and a mind.
When the morning came, Joel circled around the cramped pen – a far cry 
from the luxury of the old house, where he could roam free and see Cassie 
whenever he wanted to. He even moved all the straw into the corner, so 
that nothing obscured his letter.
He heard footsteps outside, and his heart almost stopped, and then raced, 
once he realized that there were several people there. All of them came in, 
wearing green coats, loud and laughing. Their heavy shoes trampled his 
message back into dust, and their hands grabbed Joel. He fought back, 
crying out for help, until a needle jabbed his flank.
* * * *
The afternoon sun flooded the porch, and Joel closed his eyes. It was a 
nice day, although his aching skull told him that it might rain later. Cassie 
shifted in her chair, and tickled Joel’s chin with her bare toes. He grunted 
and stretched his neck. He almost dozed off when he heard crunching of 
the gravel of the driveway. Someone was coming.
He opened his eyes. Cassie looked too, shielding her eyes from the glare, 
and put down her book. Joel glanced at the squiggly lines, and then at 
Cassie. For the life of him, he could not understand why she spent all day 
staring at the black worms that crawled on the white pages.
“Excuse me.” The visitor walked halfway up the steps that led to the porch 
and stopped, as if uncertain. “I was told that this is Dr. Kernicke’s house.”
Cassie nodded. “He’s at the Institute. It’s down the road, by the farm.”
“I know,” the visitor said. “I just wanted to talk in a more informal 
manner.” His eyes met Joel’s, and he whistled. “Say, is that the pig that…” 
He swallowed a few times but did not continue.
Cassie looked puzzled for a moment, but then smiled. “Oh yes, this is 
Joel, the wonder-pig.”
Joel lifted his head at the mentioning of his name. The rest of the words 
escaped him somehow, no matter how hard he listened.
“Joel,” the visitor repeated. “I’m Phil Marshall.”
“Oh yes.” Cassie looked at the visitor with awe. “You’re the recipient.”
The word evoked a vague displeasure in Joel, but the day was too nice to

get agitated over anything. He grunted and rolled to his side, trying to 
capture as many rays as he could before the sunset.
“And you’re Cassie,” Phil said.
“How did you know?”
Phil frowned, shook his head, and shrugged. “I don’t know. Probably 
heard it somewhere.”
“Probably,” Cassie agreed. “Father will be home soon. You want to see the 
garden meanwhile?”
Joel watched the two people walk down the steps and stroll across the 
green lawn. He tried to focus his thoughts, but they just stumbled 
about, unruly, chasing each other’s tails. There was something about that 
man, something about the way he looked at Joel that seemed familiar. 
The words ‘blank slate’ floated into his mind and dissipated, leaving no 
impression or understanding. Joel yawned. All the thinking made him 
tired, and he closed his eyes, savoring the warmth and the sun. No need 
to worry about things one could not change. And truly, Joel had no 
reason to complain. He was treated well, and he had anything a pig could 
desire. And it was getting even better – every day, he found that he had 
fewer things to worry about, that the concerns of yesterday made no sense 
today, and often left no memory. He had forgotten the smell of blood, 
and the searing pain, and the sickening sound of the tissue tearing like 
fabric. Soon, he would be truly happy.

where is my mind?
110 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Where is my mind?
The answer to the question “where is my mind,” is becoming increasingly 
difficult to answer. I would like to say that it is still “in my head,” though 
today’s society mandates that your mind be everywhere at once. We are 
not yet at the point described in “The Girl was Plugged In,” but we are 
certainly moving in that direction. While this can all seem very scary at 
first, I don’t think it is all bad. At this point in history, if someone asks 
me “where is your mind,” I can say with some degree of certainty that it is 
anywhere I want it to be.
Our history books are filled with examples of men and women who 
externalized their minds in some meaningful, lasting way. Egyptian 
engineers built the pyramids. Greek philosophers wrote volumes that 
still affect our society today. Great generals developed strategies that 
changed the landscape of the world. These people could have completed 
their great projects from the comfort of a chair, thinking about their craft 
and passing on orders to others. In this way, their mind was (and still is) 
embodied in their masterpieces. 
Until recently, most people did not have this luxury. Most members 
of our species have made our livings with our bodies. Lately though, 
it appears that this is changing. Most of us don’t really use our bodies 
anymore, and survival is pretty much a foregone conclusion in this part 
of the world. We buy food in supermarkets, we take medicine when we 
are sick, and we use planes, boats, and cars to travel extreme distances. 
Daily life is no longer a struggle (again, in this part of the world). 
These days, most of us use our minds for nearly everything. We wake 
up and check our e-mail, and send out our thoughts to others. We go to 
class or work, often by car, and rest our bodies in a chair while using our 
minds to fulfill our assigned tasks. In this networked society, we leave 
our mark in so many different places and in so many different ways these 
days that we almost take it for granted. It is a unique and exciting time, 
because we all have the opportunity to use our minds to make a tangible 
difference in the world, a privilege which we have never lived without, but 
has been reserved for the lucky few for the entirety of our existence.
Things are great now, but we have only lived in this society of opportunity 
for a very short period of time, and have no guarantee that it will last 
forever. It may not even last for my lifetime! If tomorrow you took away 
computers and the Internet and the means of mass production, what 
would happen? If our modern society crumbled and we found ourselves 
in the world that existed 100 years ago, how would we cope. Most of 
us don’t have any idea how to farm, build things, or produce clothing. 
These things are taken care of for most of us. We have never lived in a 
world that required us to use our bodies to survive, and if you asked us to 
suddenly figure it out, it would be a disaster. Living through your mind is 
preferable to surviving with your body, but as a society we must not forget 
how to take care of ourselves.

Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Where is my mind? 111
ASHLEY FUNKHOUSER
“Physical and spiritual selves”
I would like to talk about the geographic location of the mind. Where 
my mind currently is—in terms of what I am thinking about—is how 
much work I have to do, the fact that I need to declare my major, and oh 
yeah, when the heck am I going to do laundry anyway? But I don't think 
very many people care about that.
Sometimes I feel like there are two of me. I don't mean that in the sense 
that there are actually two physical beings that I inhabit, or that I have 
multiple personalities. What I mean to say is that there is my physical 
self and my spiritual self. I feel like my brain controls my body, and that 
my mind controls my spirit, or soul if you will. However, I feel like they 
inhabit the same geographic location.
Maybe that sounds really stupid. I really do believe in people having 
souls, because from the genetic and biological evidence that I've read, 
I just don't feel like the science we have in front of us can completely 
account for our personalities. For example, many times, there is no 
biological advantage to having a particular personality trait, like a specific 
sense of humor, but it is just as much as part of who I am as my genetic 
code.
To be more specific about the geographic location, I do believe that my 
brain is the home to my mind, but since my mind does not really come 
from any specific region of my brain—it seems like it's a voice that fills 
my head—they seem to be separate entities. It is for this reason that I 
thought Tiptree made sense when she was talking about the person's brain 
being in love with Paul, but through Delphi's body. However, I think it is 
the mind specifically, and not the brain that falls in love.
2.34 Love on the mind. Or brain. Dr. 
Helen Fisher—an anthropologist at Rutgers 
University—uses functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to 
correlate observable brain activity with 
human emotion. Brain scans such as this 
one depict activity in brain regions 
she associates with lust, romantic 
attraction, and attachment. See: http://

112 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Where is my mind?
On any normal occasion, I would say that my mind is located somewhere 
in the squishy part of my brain. Now that my spectrum of conceptual 
thinking has been fathomed tenfold, and after reading the pieces by 
Newitz and Tiptree, my mind could literally be anywhere. In an electrical 
hub attached to millions of wires. In a vat of goo. In South Africa. In my 
basement. Anywhere.
In Tiptree’s short story, the ‘girl’ in essence gets to escape her ugly physical 
reality and jump into a new body via technological advancements. Her 
new life is just great. Her new path is dandy. But this makes you think 
- where is her brain working? Which being is it operating? Because if a 
mind originally belongs to one being, how can it transfer to another? How 
do we know this mind is still ours? The answer is unknown, because we 
probably really don’t know and never could.
The human mind is one of the most extravagant phenomena our world 
will ever know. How could it ever be explainable if each is individually 
unique and one of a kind? How could we begin to define and pick apart 
something that is so vast and beyond what technology can aid? The scary 
part about today’s society is that we have found ways to ‘rewire’ our brains 
via chemicals, medicines, hormones, therapies, you name it. By altering 
the chemical makeup of our brains, we are changing our minds at the 
same time. Mood stabilizers, concentration aids, and even sedatives could 
play a large part in our cerebral evolution as a species. 
Could we train our brains to be perfect? Even scarier is that there are large 
parts of the brain that are still unexplained; doctors and psychologists 
don’t know what these parts of the brain are for. Perhaps technology 
advancements could soon lead the way in revealing these physical 
phenomena. Or maybe we’ll be forever ignorant! That sounds like bliss.
So we come back to the question: Where is my mind? I would like to 
think it’s located in my gooey brain. But let’s put it into perspective. If 
our minds are so powerful enough to create hallucinations and imagine 
scenarios and scenes very life-like and close to reality without being 
tangible - imagine all the possibilities! Our minds could be another world 
that we have yet to truly tap into. 
As for my mind... it’s a squishy little world I carry around with me 
everywhere I go. Deal with it.

“Is your mind in the gutter?”
The common phrase “Get your mind out of the gutter!” is used daily 
when people say something inappropriate or somewhat crude. It is 
interesting to say someone’s mind is not in their head, as it can’t really 
leave.
Or can it? We must remember it is our brain which is inside our head. 
The argument is that a person’s brain is separate from his or her mind, just 
as a body is separate from a soul. Then it also goes to the whole “thinking 
outside of the box” principle as well. Can our minds be somewhere other 
than right here, right now, inside my head? Personally, I believe the answer 
is yes.
Our minds are the greatest creations of all time. With them we form the 
most entertaining movies, innovative designs, and beautiful images. They 
also, unfortunately, create terrorist plots, bombs, and racist mentalities. 
Our minds travel to wherever we want to take them. When we dream 
both day and night we are not in the moment. If you say you have 
never been caught spacing out then you are lying. In those moments 
you have absolutely no idea what is going on in the present because you 
are drifting. I have found myself reading a book and get to the end of a 
paragraph and snap to and realize I have absolutely no idea what I just 
read because I was thinking about something else. Either I have ridiculous 
ADD which needs to be addressed or my mind just likes to wander. 
The way we use our minds, however, is directly influenced by media and 
other technology. Medicines such as Adderall were invented to keep our 
minds focused on what we need to do rather than on things we want to 
do. The media also give us things to constantly think about. Video games, 
women, and sports all are distractions which some of us think about 
throughout the day. The beauty of our minds is that we can think the way 
we do. It is up to us to decide where our minds are. 
My mind drifts a lot. I like that it does this because it never lets me get 
bored. Having a great imagination allows you to view things in many 
different ways. Sooner or later, there will be technology which controls 
what we are allowed to think about and when we can think it. When those 
days come it will suck. 
Our minds can take us anywhere we want on earth, and no restrictions 
should be placed on where we go. When we control our minds inside our 
own brains inside our own heads, we are truly in power.
2.36 We are not the end of the trail by 
any means. Excerpt from Timothy Leary’s 
Neurocomics (Last Gasp Press, 1979). 
114 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Where is my mind?
This question has been weighing on me ever since reading the “Brain in a 
Vat” scenario in philosophy during the second semester of my freshman 
year. The idea that every perceived moment of my life could be the 
creation of a variety of electrical impulses shooting through a disembodied 
brain is disconcerting to say the least. 
Once one realizes that there is really no way to know whether or not your 
thoughts are really your own or the production of someone else, the idea 
of living life takes on a new meaning. What is there to live for if there’s 
the possibility that every single moment we experience is completely 
fabricated by outside sources? 
Newitz takes this idea one step further with her discussion of a movie 
where a disembodied mind takes over that of a living human. What does 
this mean for the mind? If our minds can be hacked in such a thorough 
manner, who’s to say that anything we do is of our own creation? 
The ability to do mental labor then becomes a commodity. Being able 
to control one’s mind is a power, and those who have it are successful. 
But this does not diminish the threat that our minds are hackable. The 
disembodied head of a bitter deceased wife can call upon the wrath of an 
unkempt creation to destroy their common creator. 
This concept is frightening. If the mind truly can transcend the 
boundaries of our bodies and influence the actions of others, there is no 
telling what will happen. The population as a whole consists of too many 
mean spirited and truly bad components for mind control (or takeover as 
the case may be) would prove to be devastating. Yet, these fears have not 
been realized. So far as we know, our minds have not been able to reach 
out and influence the minds of others, but technology may bring about a 
vehicle for which it may do so.
Upon reading Tiptree’s short story, the movie Avatar comes to mind. It 
seems like the technologies in this situation are of a similar type. A body 
is created, and through somehow plugging one’s consciousness into said 
body, one can control is as if it were their own. And in both situations the 
driving factor for the whole operation is a simple matter of greed. Tiptree’s 
Remote serves as a walking advertisement for GTX. Delphi stays plugged 
into the life of a “God” in a society where covert advertisements are a 
lifestyle for the rich, famous, and remote controlled. 
Create the perfect product model, and find the perfect brain to control 
it in a way that will create the most profit. Though Delphi is the merely 
the receptacle for neural output, she serves as the body for the entire 
population. Once the goddess Delphi is seen doing something, or using a 
new product, the consumer world follows suit.
P. Burke’s plug in goes past the shell of Delphi, and directly into the 
lives of the consumer population. In Avatar, the remote is used to aide

in obtaining an invaluable mineral. An entire planet is on schedule to be 
thrown away for the love of money. 
So when I read the question “Where is your mind?” I can’t give a 
definitive answer. For all I know, my mind may be the result of a 
computer program running through a brain sitting lonesome in a vat 
of brain juice. But I know where humanity’s collective mind is headed, 
and it’s being lead by the outreaching influence of the minds at work in 
advertising.
Though they may not be directly altering our brains or transferring our 
minds into the body of another, they influence our though processes, 
choices, and actions nonetheless. This being the case, it’s scary to think 
about what might happen when Avatar style technology comes out. The 
worry is present- there are even movies coming out and addressing the 
situation. 
Where is my mind? Heading towards insanity because I’ve been thinking 
about these concepts far too much.

116 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Where is my mind?
Where is my mind? The Pixies suggest that if your head were to collapse 
you would be left asking yourself this very question. However, how can 
we be sure that your mind is actually located in your head? 
Through readings such as James Tiptree’s, “The Girl Who Was Plugged 
In,” we are provided the possibility that a mind could span across space 
and locate one person while feeling and thinking for another. 
This “girl,” that Tiptree tells us about, has been provided with the 
opportunity to escape the body that her mind once occupied. By 
attaching metal and wires to her brain they are able to transmit her 
thoughts and feelings into a new body. This futuristic idea gets us 
thinking about the possibilities of the future and the question of where 
our mind is located; is it in just one spot?
I began to think about this. When I think, it feels like it is coming from 
my head, but is that because I am told that is where my thoughts fester? 
Maybe I am thinking with my heart or my stomach, two organs central 
to human survival. Or maybe my thoughts do not come from any one 
place, but rather, they are a compilation of all of my organs and body 
parts working together to develop my thoughts. 
If this is the case, I wonder if it would ever be possible to transmit the 
mind of someone into another vessel. By attaching transmitters and 
futuristic technologies to a human being it may be possible to send 
through space or wires that persons thoughts and make them sink with 
the functions of another being. Then our mind would no longer be in a 
specific place, rather, it could be everywhere or anywhere we wanted it.

“Where is my mind? Well, it’s right here... I think.”
I know where my brain is. 
It is floating around in my head somewhere (which, by the way... ew). I 
know that generally when we think of the mind we think of the brain as 
well. But are they the same thing? Nope.
Just as the organ that is the heart and the idea of the soul are distinctly 
different, so are the brain and the mind. When I think of the brain 
and the mind, this is how I imagine the difference. I imagine the brain 
controlling the typing motions of your hands, making you be able to put 
one foot in front of the other, being responsible for arranging the muscles 
in your face to make you have a smile. 
The mind, in my opinion (I almost said “in my mind”...ironic, huh?), is 
responsible for the conscious decisions you make to type something, to 
walk, to smile. I imagine the brain telling your mouth to smile and the 
mind being what processes the fact that you should smile. Of course, this 
is just how I think of things and is in no way, shape, or form scientific at 
all.
The question is “where is my mind?” Well, it is wherever I am. If I am 
watching a sad movie, then my mind is processing the sadness of the 
movie and telling me/my brain to react accordingly. In terms of actual 
geography I have no clue where it is, but for convention’s sake I’m going 
to say somewhere in the vicinity of my brain. 
What Newitz and Tiptree are talking about—mind control and such—
seems like such a strange, foreign concept. Technologically we are not far 
away from being able to do the things they describe. However, will we 
ever actually go for that? I mean, I’m sure some people will jump onto the 
mind-control bandwagon for curiosity or whatever’s sake. But humanity 
as a whole? 
At least at first, people will be very resistant. People tend to like being in 
control. At least I know that I do, and the idea of someone else dictating 
my actions or thoughts or movements or, well, anything kind of terrifies 
me. 
I do not know if my conceptions of where my mind is are correct. But I 
do know that, wherever my mind is, I like being in control of it and being 
the only one who knows what’s going on in it. And I’d like to keep it that 
way.

My mind is where I want it to be, but others may control it in the near 
future. The mind can be changed by many things: the environment, 
others, and social interactions. What if I told you that the environment 
you live in was constructed for people like us just to buy things? That’s 
what James Tiptree’s short story ”The Girl Who Was Plugged In” suggests. 
I know this is much for one to wrap their mind around, but let me 
explain my points.
Media are the most obvious controllers of the mind. Remember all those 
advertisements that you laugh at? Research shows that those are the ones 
you remember the best and thus cause you to buy the product. What 
about shows like the OC, in which drama seems to lurk at every turn? 
Sure enough, you may start acting like the characters and buying products 
to seem more like them. 
The corporations portrayed in the short story “The Girl Who Was 
Plugged In” seems completely unrelatable to present day corporations, but 
it’s not a stretch to imagine the scenario unfolding. All those celebrities 
you love can cause you to do things like buy products, watch their media, 
and relate yourself even further with the celebrity puts money in the 
corporations pocket. 
These people are obviously controlling your mind now, so why is it so far fetched that the corporations right now are controlling you? When you 
went out last time to buy a gallon of milk you probably bought the same 
one that you have been buying all your life, but when you looked at the 
other brands of milk you may have remembered a slogan, or a commercial 
from that other brand. While you didn’t buy that brand of milk now, later 
on when you switch brands of milk, you might remember the slogan or 
advertisement and buy the milk.
Yes, I think honestly that the brain is easily corrupted, but we still have 
some control over it. Even though we think that all our decisions are 
ours to make, we may not have as much power over our thoughts that we 
believe. At the moment, the answer to the question “where is my mind” is 
“where I want it to be.” 
In the future, the answer may be “wherever I am told.”

“Just an organ with signals.”
Many people believe that the mind may not necessarily be in the brain. 
Many religious people believe that their soul controls much of what 
they do. Or their God controls their actions, meaning that their mind is 
not completely their own but run by something else. Others believe in 
reincarnation so their mind or soul can be transplanted to have a fresh 
start while trying to become closer to perfection. I believe that the mind 
and the brain are the same thing. 
I think that the brain and the mind is just an organ with signals that 
stores information and makes decisions about ourselves and controls our 
body. Bionic arms can be controlled by the brain, but there has to be the 
correct signal. A brain or mind can control something that is not hooked 
up to it. 
A technology such as that described in “The Girl Who Was Plugged In” is 
plausible, but the technology in the movie Avatar is not. In Avatar, Jake’s 
mind is transported into another body. But a mind cannot be transported 
without the brain. 
Tiptree’s story works because their is not much feedback from the body. 
But, during the sex scene in Avatar, Jake has genital feelings without a 
machine telling his brain that he should feel it. 
I also believe that when the brain dies, the mind dies with it. The brain 
deteriorates with age. So how can people live that much longer if their 
brains start to malfunction with memory loss and slower processing? 
I also don’t believe that a machine can have a mind. So transferring the 
knowledge of a brain to a computer doesn’t make the computer equal to 
the mind. So in conclusion, a mind is a terrible thing to waste, and trying 
to turn a mind into a machine would mean the loss of the mind and the 
brain. 
2.42 What the mind can see, it can create. 
Excerpt from Timothy Leary’s Neurocomics 
(Last Gasp Press, 1979). 
120 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Where is my mind?
I haven’t lost my mind. I assure you, I am completely sane. 
The question posed was “Where is my mind?” Because of my interest 
in psychology, I argue that it is in your brain. This seems fairly straight 
forward but others argue that your “mind” is in your heart or well... other 
places. 
Without getting too philosophical, how do you define mind? I define it 
as that part of a person that makes them human; it’s what allows us to 
learn everything from mathematics to new social cues, and it is also what 
processes and regulates emotions and stores memories. There is obviously 
more to our mind than that, but those are the criterion I intend to focus 
on. 
On the subject of memory storage, the brain is where your memories 
are stored. No doubt about it. We know that memories are stored in the 
brain; we just aren’t sure how this happens. “How do you know?” you 
might ask. Have you ever heard of a person receiving a heart transplant 
and suddenly possessing new memories? Or a new kidney? Or did they 
lose their arm and subsequently the memory of their wedding? 
No. No you haven’t heard of such things. But have you heard of someone 
getting Alzheimer’s—a neurological disorder affecting the brain—and 
forgetting words and events and people’s names? If you said “no” then 
you, sir/madam, are a liar. Memories are only affected when parts of the 
brain are affected. This is inherently tied to the learning aspect of the 
brain as well. 
As for emotions? This one is pretty easy. Emotions are regulated by the 
brain. The brain processes neurotransmitters and interprets different 
levels of serotonin, melatonin, dopamine, endorphins, and adrenaline as 
emotions. This has been documented. Happiness, sadness, depression, 
anger, and all the emotions you feel are interpreted by the brain. The 
transmitter might be produced elsewhere, as is the case of adrenaline, but 
nothing happens until they get to the brain. The brain is emotional center 
of humans.
My mind is in my brain. If you were to switch my brain with another 
person, I would still be me, just in their body.

AARON PASSER
“The doors of perception”
Well, not exactly; mescaline seems a bit extreme. Throughout history the 
advancement of modern medicine has slowly but surely unlocked the keys 
to our brain, allowing our minds to go places never before imaginable. 
The study of pharmacology has allowed us to understand how drugs and 
supplements affect the different parts of our body, especially the brain. 
Today there seems to be an endless amount of ways that one can alter 
their mind or state of consciousness. Even widely used drugs like caffeine 
allow us to enter into an altered state of mind, no matter how small that 
shift may be. 
Moving up the ladder, we have drugs like Focalin, Adderall, and Ritalin. 
These psychoactive drugs make us focus and concentrate at the task at 
hand; really, they are pretty much like cocaine, as they all have similar 
chemical makeups.
Now lets get to the good stuff. 
As Timothy Leary once said, “you’re only as young as the last time you 
changed your mind.” As we found out in class last week, he was a huge 
advocate of the psychoactive drug LSD and its ability to allow us to 
“tune in, turn on and drop out.” Modern medicine has debunked the 
thought that LSD and other psychedelic drugs take us somewhere and 
reveal great truths to us. Rather, they simply make neurons in our brain 
fire in irregular ways. This might be true, but ultimately it is up to the 
individual experiencing the drug to interpret it however they choose, 
whether it is an experience of spiritual or religious enlightenment or 
something lesser. 
These experiences can drastically change the individual, but it is more 
likely that the user will be opened to new ways of thinking about 
everything. The mind can be pushed in many directions. 
I am in no way advocating the use of these drugs. The mind is a fragile 
thing and we only get one. These technologies are best in moderation. 
It takes time and research to prepare the mind for such possible shifts in 
consciousness and these tools are not for everyone. 
The mind is truly the most amazing thing about our biology. 
We have only scratched the surface of the places where it can take us. 
2.44 Psychedelic blotter art. Scientific 
and medical experimentation with LSD 
began in the late 1940s when a Swiss 
chemist stumbled across an ergot alkaloid 
that produced a psychedelic state of 
consciousness. With substantial funding 
from the Federal Government, researchers 
conducted experiments on LSD from the 
1950s through the 1ate 1970s. Eventually, 
the stigma of the youth counter-culture 
led to an almost complete ban on LSD 
research and the last FDA-approved study 
was terminated in 1980. In recent years, 
medical research has resumed around the 
world, with much attention focused on the 
use of psychedelics to treat anxieties 
associated with terminal illness. It’s 
important to note that reckless use of 
psychedelics can be extremely dangerous.

“Singularity survival”
My project is a blog on how to survive after the Singularity, hence the name 
“Singularity Survival.” 
In my blog I talk about the different types of technology and their future 
implications and uses. The blog started off as me just highlighting various 
technologies and then turned into what it is now, as I realized that was 
not going to be enough. Many of the ideas from my blog have come from 
pop-culture as well as concepts and themes discussed in the class. The blog is 
designed to educate and provoke thought in the reader but at the same time 
be entertaining to read. The posts are shorter than news stories, but I feel that 
helps in today’s Internet world, where readers are moving from one site to the 
other and often have five or six separate sites open at once. 
 I start the blog by giving instances of current technology and then taking the 
underlying concept behind them and re-imagining that device in the future. 
The ideas are not so far off and are absolutely, in my mind, realistically 
possible. For instance, the idea that your house could be individually powered 
by these “Bloom Boxes” or that everyone could be using the “glove-mouse” in 
their homes one day, are both definite possibilities. 
I then move into the next part of the blog: things that I would like to see in 
the future. In this section I talk mainly about sports and flying cars. The flying 
cars post is more of a rant than it is an informative post. The sports post is 
designed to have the reader think about what he/she would like to see in the 
future, although I do give an example of something I would kind of like to see. 
In the final section of posts, at the time of this summary, I give cautions about 
the future. In particular I talk about the idea of robots taking over the world. 
While I may not specifically address the issue of artificial intelligence(AI), 
the point is there nonetheless. This section is meant to provoke thoughts in the 
reader such as: are robots replacing humans really a good thing? What are the 
implications of programming them to do things such as cut and slice and how 
could it potentially affect humans in the future if AI comes into existence. 
Charging Mats will Be Everywhere
Posted in Energy, Technology on March 25, 2010 by andrewtcoe
Today’s post is on those charging mat things that have come out in the 
past year. You know what I’m talking about. 
You’ve seen the ads for them everywhere and any time you walk into 
BestBuy they’re right there at the front. You know the basic concept of 
how they work too. You put this extra shell on your device of choice and 
it has this extra pad on the back which receives wireless energy from the 
mat and transmits it to your device to power/charge it. Well imagine this 
technology taken to the next level. You come in from a long day at work 
you sit down at your desk at home and your Internet surfing device is 
dead. Currently you would have to go get the charger, find an outlet, plug 
in the charger then plug in your device. With the Powermat technology in 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Surviving the Singularity 125
combination with the Bloom Box from the last post you merely walk over 
to your desk, which is made of the Powermat technology, and set your 
device on the desk…instant power! And there are no cords attached to the 
desk because your house is powered wirelessly by the Bloom Box. Now 
why can’t your device just charge wirelessly because of the Bloom Box? 
Why won’t my DVDs from the US play in Europe? Because companies 
make things unnecessarily complicated and I do not see that changing in 
the future. So that is my post on the Powermat! Don’t be caught without 
your Powerdesk in the future!
Sports in the Future
Posted in Uncategorized on April 13, 2010 by andrewtcoe
Alright so this is something that is near and dear to my heart: Sports. 
How will sports work in the future? How will athletes be? What new 
drugs will they use to enhance performance? Will they be illegal? I don’t 
know. Will there be new sports? I think so. I think there will always be 
new sports coming into the market. I don’t think they will be original 
though, I could see some sort of futuristic football or soccer or any 
combination of other sports. I would love to hear what ideas other people 
have.
Medical Science post-Singularity
Posted in Uncategorized on April 20, 2010 by andrewtcoe
Medicine has come a long way in the past 100 years: Anasthesia, 
Penicillin, Aspirin, etc… and—after the Singularity—it will continue to 
advance as it has. In fact there are already some incredible devices available 
today. 
Imagine being able to do get all your medical data to any doctor that 
sees you. No more messing with files and getting them faxed over. You 
can keep digital copies for yourself and on you at all times. Instead of 
working in hospitals with huge equipment, everything is getting smaller 
and doctors can now take their gear with them, which means remote areas 
of the world are now able to get medical care. With these technologies we 
can help curtail the infant mortality rate in countries like Burkina Faso 
and Ghana and Angola. The opportunities are endless! 
Also a future with less disease is a distinct possibility. Can you imagine if 
there was an AIDS vaccine or even an anti-viral? Or if someone developed 
a way to detect cancerous genome sequences and alter them? Or being 
able to have fully functioning prosthetic limbs like that from the previous 
post? I am very excited about the future of medical science and it is one of 
those areas you should definitely keep your eye on!
A Public Service Announcement – Brought to you by SkyNet
Posted in Robots on May 11, 2010 by andrewtcoe
Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to talk to you today about a very serious 
issue: robots with weapons. You may not know it but robots are a very 
serious threat to humanity. Recently, the Chinese government has built 
126 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Surviving the Singularity
robots to help with jobs in hazardous environments where it is difficult for 
humans to go. The problem with this is one of those “scientists” gave one 
of the robots a sword!
This is not a rumor based on a photoshopped image. This is real. It is a 
very real threat that the population of the world needs to be aware of. 
While they might look cute, they will inevitably turn into Terminator 
assassins.
For now, just be wary. Hopefully someone will come up with a way to 
combat these things when they eventually decide to take over the world.
This has been a public service announcement.
UPDATE on Robots – They like to stab things
Posted in Robots on May 11, 2010 by andrewtcoe
Apparently German scientists wanted to see what would happen if they 
gave a robot a knife. Well, they stab things. Not even joking. They gave 
a robot a knife and stuck a whole bunch of stuff that is similar to human 
tissue around it just to see what the hell would happen. 
What the hell did you think was gonna happen? It was gonna magically 
grow a conscience and be like ”I can’t cut this, this is similar to human 
tissue.”? NO! If it was thinking anything, it was thinking “KILL KILL 
KILL!”. I tried to warn people but noooo, now we’re giving them weapons 
and letting them know that they are, indeed physically superior to us.

“Hacking humanity”
For my project, I decided to make a movie. I mean, I would like to go 
into film production as a career path, so I figured now was as perfect an 
oppurtunity as any to see what I could do here. Now as far as format 
and subject matter went, I decided a documentary approach may be the 
best way to go, seeing as I wouldn’t have to worry about a script, actors, 
narrative and any other things that could bog down the message. In the 
end, I decided to interview students I know from around Trinity, asking 
them some basic questions about the transhumanist movement to see 
what their gut reactions were. I wanted people outside our class, to see 
how someone who hasn’t really been exposed to these kinds of ideas 
would respond to them. So I ended up with eight legitimate interviewees: 
Ryan Darley, Indy Jones, Erika Friedmeyer, Derek Leader, Alexa Harrison, 
Laura Izzo, JJ Lubinski, and Hilary Elaine Moore and asked them a few 
questions regarding transhumanism.
In addition to these eight people, I also enlisted my roommate Nick 
Theccanat and classmate Chris Kradle to provide some comic-relief to 
keep things from becoming too monotonous.
By the time the interviews were done, I got a decent range of opinions. 
Admittedly, most of the people I interviewed were wary of neuroceuticals 
with Ryan asserting, “I don’t agree with drugs that are going to change 
how you feel.” And while Erika conceded that it could “help control 
mood swings and what are considered undesirable emotions” she feared 
that “when we take away people’s emotions it kind of takes away their 
humanity.”
As far as life extension goes, most students were fine with using 
technology to extend our life spans but drew the line at striving 
for immortality. JJ explained that “the idea of becoming immortal 
is essentially becoming a god,” and Laura pointed out that unless 
immortality is attained for everybody, then eventually we’ll realize that 
while we’re still alive, “everyone [we] know has died.”
Using transhumanism for “fun” purposes got more mixed responses. Indy 
was quick to comment that walking around with four arms “would be 
awesome,” and Alexa figured that “if someone wants a third hand … and 
is rich” they could get it and join the circus, but otherwise, she didn’t “see 
it as very practical.” Hilary seemed to be thinking along the same lines 
and finished by commenting, “It seems pretty dumb to me.”
As for concerns with the whole movement, Chris, in his fake interview 
expressed concerns regarding artificially cultivated meat and my other fake 
interviewee Nick expressed fear of a terminator situation. The others were 
more concerned with more realistic issues. Both Erika and Ryan pointed 
to how with all new technology, there plenty of potential for things to 
“go wrong.” They all also speculated about who would be in charge of 
developing and distributing any of this technology, with many students 
pointing to the private sector, though Derek explained that there will

Jones, Alexa Harrison, Ryan Darley, Erika 
Friedmeyer, and Nick Theccanat.
128 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Surviving the Singularity
inevitably be some sort of government regulation and JJ expressed concern 
over intellectual property rights.
When asked if this technology will be attainable in our lifetimes, 
responses were again somewhat mixed. While Derek was quick to point 
out groundbreaking progress we’ve made already, citing how bionic eyes 
are already on the way, and Ryan said he “wouldn’t be surprised to see it 
in ten to twenty years,” others like Indy and Laura were not as convinced 
that we would be this advanced any time soon. Similarly Alexa did not 
see this coming about in the near future either, but not because of our 
scientific ability, but rather because of the “ethics issues” surrounding 
these advancements. In the end, what they all were able to agree on was 
that this was “a crazy topic.”
After recording the interviews, I sat down with Windows Movie Maker 
and intertwined short portions of each of these interviews together into 
one cohesive thread of responses and answers to my questions. I also made 
use of DragonForce’s Through the Fire and Flames and Mussorgsky’s 
Promenade movement from his Pictures at an Exhibition for the segments 
between each thread of responses. In the end, I was pretty happy with 
how this movie turned out. I got about thirteen minutes out of nearly two 
hours of interviews, and I think I did pretty well getting the key moments 
from each interview into the final cut.

130 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automata (Short fiction)
When Jason Graves awoke he found himself curled up next to the very 
edge of his bed and instinctively flinched in fear that he was about to 
fall to the floor below. As he shifted back toward the center of the bed, 
Jason sat up with a wince and glanced at the venetian blinds that covered 
his apartment window. A muted stream of daylight filtering through the 
cracks suggested that he had been torn from sleep in the still early hours 
of the morning. His internal processor sensed his desire and pulled a 
clock into view on his HUD. It read 6:08. The heated covers slid off as 
he turned to let his legs hang over the side of the mattress. Sitting there 
for a moment, Jason sighed and clutched his head. 
Dreamt on my own again, he thought while trying to recall the stream of 
broken images still drifting at the back of his head. I remember floating 
in a sea of clear, oily liquid and I had been alone there for a long time. There 
was heat; an unbearable heat all around… the sky above me cast a dim light 
as if the sun had just passed through a thick red membrane. But then the light 
went out and the heat was gone. I could feel the sea around me grow cold, 
crystallizing until my entire body was enveloped in the ice. 
Piece of shit dreamware, it was supposed to be about flying… I guess that’s the 
last time I download a freebie. Jason looked up from his hands and toward 
the door of his apartment. I might as well get up now.
After Jason stood up and began walking towards the bathroom his eyes 
automatically switched to IR illumination mode, bathing the faintly light 
room in a phosphorescent white. The door slid neatly into the side of its 
frame as he approached and the lights blinked on softly so as not to hurt 
his now light sensitive eyes. With a sharp hiss the shower turned on to 
the appropriate temperature and the glass door slid open graciously. Jason 
allowed his eyes to return to their normal setting, taking in the shadows 
splayed upon the white tiled walls for a brief moment before the light 
gradually brightened to its full intensity. The recessed television within 
the bathroom mirror flicked on from behind but Jason took no notice of 
it as he disrobed and stepped into the shower. He remained fixated on the 
wall in front of him, trying to ignore the advertisement for a new body 
model playing in the background. 
Commercials, I can already hear that empty voiceover playing out its mock 
love song desperate for my attention: 
Are you unsatisfied?
Do you have a body?
Flesh that reeks?
Bones that creek?
Hollow cheeks?
COLE GRAY
“Automata”
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automota (Short fiction) 131
Veins that leak?
Order now and be fulfilled.
With a thought Jason changed the channel to the local news station. The 
newscasters were in the middle of a story concerning recent developments 
in spaceflight that would greatly lower the costs of immigration to the 
growing number of colonies in orbit. They talked back and forth about 
how the colonies had once been the exclusive locale for the rich or 
politically powerful but would now permit even the common man to earn 
his place among the stars. The program then shifted to a report on the 
growing descent among many of the religious sects in regard to human 
immortality and genetic engineering. Some of the more fundamental 
groups had begun advocating terrorism and mass suicide as an act of 
righteous rebellion against humanity’s permanent separation from God.
Jason turned the television off as the air around him began to thicken 
with steam and he felt its heavy heat spread to the very bottom of his 
artificial lungs. He made a motion toward the shower door but before 
his fingers could even make contact with the glass, the water slowed to a 
trickle and the door slid open before him. He stepped out onto the slick 
tiled floor, took a towel from the silver plated rack and ran his hand across 
the layer of condensation that had accumulated upon the mirror. The 
excess water ran down to the bottom rim, leaving a polished network of 
veins in its wake. 
He stood there and gazed at the figure that appeared before him. It 
seemed impossible that Jason was in his late fifties yet had the perfect 
build of a man no more than thirty years old. Lean and muscular with a 
head full of wavy black hair–he looked as though he was still in the prime 
of his life. However, the most striking aspects of his body were the two 
completely black eyes set deep within his brow. They were unsettling to 
say the least since without any pupils or irises it was impossible to tell 
precisely where he was looking at any given moment. But while Jason 
knew they were not as appealing to look at as some of the more designer 
friendly sets made to resemble real human eyes, they were far more 
durable and easier to modify when the circumstances demanded it. After 
another quick onceover Jason toweled off and crossed back into his living 
room. 
He dressed quickly, throwing on a few articles of clothing that he found 
laying at the front of his closet and a pair of heavy boots that had been 
kicked off in exhaustion the night before. Jason’s revolver was still in its 
shoulder holster and draped over the banister of his bed. He drew it out, 
loaded it with a few spare shells he kept on his nightstand and slid it back 
into place as he pulled his arms through the nylon straps. The sun’s early 
morning glow had begun to weave its way throughout the room, blurring 
the boundaries of the retreating shadows. Jason looked over toward the 
window blinds. 
Up. With a jump the blinds collected to the top of the window and 
Jason peered out into the dense urban landscape of Chicago. The entire 
132 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automata (Short fiction)
city was still steeped in the dark amber glow of the morning sun while at 
the center a distant streak of light glinted off the windows of the tallest 
buildings like a sputtering flame. 
Better grab something to eat before I’m called in.
His HUD indicated that it would be cold outside that day so he grabbed 
an old coat on his way out. 
Jason emerged from his apartment complex and shivered when a bitter 
wind spilled out through the open streets. Sticking his hands deep into 
his jacket pockets, he began to walk down the narrow sidewalk and 
straight into the heart of the city though it wasn’t long before the relative 
peace of the residential areas was devoured in the shimmering deluge of 
sounds and shapes that had began to wink on around Jason. They flitted 
about in garish colors and called out his name in demand that he pay full 
attention to their witty little slogans and promises of lower prices. Jason 
tried to ignore their collective shrieks, knowing that they weren’t really 
there but merely bits of holographic data projected into his augmented 
mind. Yet, there were so many of these floating billboards that at times 
it looked as if the buildings around him were consumed in an immense 
neon inferno. 
By the fourth block it had already started to get crowded as a wave of 
pedestrians swept out against Jason and enveloped him into their fold. It 
was that same dull and frantic movement that Jason had always known; 
people clambering past each other, so eager to find themselves among 
the tasks at hand. However, there was no end to the variety of forms on 
display. There were, of course, the standard human chasses which were 
worn by the vast majority of people and almost indiscernible from their 
organic counterparts. Nevertheless, it was impossible to tell if what was 
being worn resembled the actual person on the inside. As Jason worked 
his way through the mass of people a five year old girl wormed past him 
and disappeared between the legs of those ahead of him. 
There could be a sixty or seventy year old man beneath the little red wool coat. 
Still, every so often the more conspicuous anomalies could be spotted 
within the flourish of pedestrians. A dark pink girl with smiley faces for 
eyes walked out in front of Jason from a shoe store. On the other side of 
the road a couple of furries laughed together outside of a coffee shop, their 
tales flicking about absent mindedly. Further down a man with four eyes 
and two curved horns on his head stood waiting for the light to change at 
a crosswalk. 
After a few more blocks Jason stopped in front of a small building at the 
corner of the street. Its front entrance was flanked by a few empty tables 
and chairs that remained largely unused during the winter time. An old 
awning hung overhead, snapping back and forth in the breeze with the 
words “The Unreal Café” printed neatly on it. The door slid open and a 
balmy breath wafted out against Jason through the raw morning air. He 
could smell the sweet scent of baked bread and coffee mingling together 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automota (Short fiction) 133
from within the back kitchen. 
Jason seated himself in a small round table in the corner of the room and 
opened the virtual menu that had popped up at the bottom of his HUD 
the moment he entered. After mentally flipping through it at least twice 
he closed the document and ordered a large cup of coffee, two eggs and 
a piece of toast. The cost was automatically deducted from his checking 
account. 
While Jason waited for his order to go through he looked across at the 
other occupied tables. One of the people nearest to him was a well 
dressed man sitting bolt upright with a slightly dazed expression on 
his face. As Jason continued to stare, a bright red ring of text appeared 
around the man’s head with the word “Online” repeated over and 
over again until it circled back around to the beginning. A box of text 
opened up directly below it, displaying the man’s personal profile; birth 
date, phone number, hobbies and all of the other labels that people 
brand themselves with. At another table a couple sat together, chatting 
pleasantly over their meals. Jason’s mind recognized their mouth patterns 
and automatically translated it into a stream of text that appeared at the 
bottom of his HUD. They were on vacation and talking about all of the 
different places they should visit that day. 
Eventually, a young looking girl in a uniform emerged from the back of 
the room with a white ceramic plate in her hands and set it gently in front 
of Jason, careful not to spill the brimming cup of coffee out onto the clean 
tablecloth. She flashed a sycophantic smile at him while setting down his 
silverware.
“Enjoy your meal, sir.”
Jason nodded slightly in her direction, “Thank you.” 
Once she had retreated back to the kitchen Jason put the cup to his lips 
and drank deeply. The coffee was still too hot but the prickling feeling 
at the back of his tongue was the perfect pick-me-up in the morning. 
After setting the cup back down, Jason picked up a knife and fork and 
began to cut into his eggs. They weren’t ‘real’ eggs though–they were 
artificial. Most food was heavily modified on a genetic level in order to 
provide the specific set of nutrients and vitamins necessary for prosthetic 
bodies to survive. These foods tasted real and looked exactly like their 
natural counterparts but they were nevertheless different on the most 
fundamental level.
I wonder if it even has a taste at all. Jason thought while examining a piece 
of egg impaled on the end of his fork. Or is my brain just simulating the 
flavor of real eggs while I’m eating some kind of bland, spongy substitute? As he took a bite into his egg, Jason noticed that the phone icon on his 
HUD had appeared and began to flash. The number below it showed 
that the call was coming from David Ledford, the chief of police. Answer. 
134 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automata (Short fiction)
-Hello Dave, what’s going on?
-Graves, I need you to get over to North Michigan Avenue right now. We have 
a big situation on our hands. 
-Well, I did just start eating breakfast…could you give me a few more details 
on how serious it is before I have to drag myself all the way down there? 
-I don’t have time for any of your crap today Graves, just get down here 
immediately!
-Fine, I’m on my way. 
Jason took a couple more bites from his plate then finished off with a swig 
of coffee to wash the taste of grease down his throat. Wiping his mouth 
on a napkin, he stood up from his seat and walked back out into the cold. 
 Back on the sidewalk, Jason glanced to his left and then to his right. The 
streets were becoming more congested with traffic and pedestrians with 
each hour.
I could try to go back home and get my car from the parking garage. No, 
that would probably take even more time. The place isn’t that far from here 
anyway. I could just run there. 
At first Jason set off at a slight jog, carefully working through the horde 
of people that covered the sidewalks. Yet with each step the pace of 
his augmented legs quickened and his stride grew impossibly long and 
powerful. When Jason finally broke out onto the road the world around 
him had melted away into a torrent of indistinct shapes and pigments 
that flowed so swiftly that only his enhanced mind could unravel their 
meaning and guide him in the right direction. The only sound was the 
edge of the wind constantly shrieking in protest past his ears.
While moving at speeds in excess of 40 mph, Jason reached his 
destination in a few minutes. 
Looks like Dave wasn’t lying.
The entire street was blocked off by police officers and SWAT team 
members, the majority of which were huddled around a group of 
parked police cars in front of the crime scene. It was an expensive lunch 
and breakfast restaurant called “Marie’s” and like most of the modern 
buildings the outside was streamlined, with less bulk customary of the 
previous decades. It had a glazed façade made of dark plated glass and 
was supported by a light-steel frame. A large holographic sign still floated 
above main doorway. Jason approached the barrier of bright yellow tape 
and transmitted his digital badge at the officers on guard. One of the 
guards studied him for a moment and then waved him through. 
“Okay, come on in. Chief Ledford wants to speak with you.”
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automota (Short fiction) 135
Jason leaned under the tape and walked over to the pack of squad cars. 
Ledford was there, leaning on the hood of one of the cars with a lit 
cigarette in hand and a large mound of burnt out butts in a coffee cup 
next to him. A considerable number of officers stood alongside him, each 
with their guns trained on the doorway as if they expected something to 
leap out at them from within. 
“What’s the trouble Dave?”
Ledford glanced back at Jason and stood up. 
“You sure got here quick Graves.” He took a drag on his smoldering 
cigarette and blew out an even ribbon of smoke, “I didn’t even expect you 
to show up at all.”
“Well you know me Dave, always willing to serve and protect. Now tell 
me what’s going on before I come to my senses and go back home.”
Ledford turned back toward the restaurant and beckoned for Jason to 
come closer to the car. Jason came forward, inching his way past the 
throng of anxious looking officers and took a spot next to Ledford. 
“We got a call at around 6 o’clock from a bystander in hysterics. She 
said that she had been out on a walk with her husband this morning but 
when they passed by Marie’s she noticed that nobody was moving on the 
inside and some people were lying on the floor. Her husband had rushed 
inside to try and help some of them but he also collapsed the moment he 
stepped through the doorway. We got here, secured the perimeter and 
ran a sweep over the entire area. It turns out that it’s some kind of fast 
acting viral field being emitted from within the restaurant. I’ve never seen 
anything like it before so I called you, seeing as you’re the expert when it 
comes to cases like these.” 
Ledford snubbed out his cigarette on the hood of the car.
“Do we have any leads on suspects? From the sound of it whoever we’re 
dealing with here has access to some pretty high end equipment.”
“That’s the thing,” he said while taking out another cigarette from his 
pack. “Our scans indicated that there’s still one living person inside 
and that he’s the source of the virus, but he hasn’t made any demands or 
anything else yet. He’s just sitting in there.”
Jason’s eyes narrowed. 
“Who is it?”
Ledford lit up and gave a few thoughtful puffs before answering.
“His name is Robert Koch, a high class chef who works further uptown. 
We did a complete background check and he doesn’t seem to have ties 
with any known terrorist groups. Here I’ll send you his profile.”
136 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automata (Short fiction)
A picture appeared in Jason’s HUD. He was a slightly older looking man, 
with tightly curled blond hair and rather thick facial features. Below 
it was the man’s personal information and a list of the more notable 
augmentations that his body was equipped with. As a cook his prosthetics 
weren’t quite as sophisticated or powerful as Jason’s but his hands were 
modified with the latest in cutlery and other cooking utensils required for 
his job.
“I assume that you’ve tried shutting down his body remotely?” 
“Yeah we tried that, but no effect. He must have some type of heavy duty 
encryption code on his cyber brain or a blocking device on him.”
 Jason kept going over the record in his mind. There wasn’t a trace of 
advanced computer or cyber hacking in the man’s past but the kind of 
skills that would have been necessary to pull off something like this were 
far beyond even the most advanced levels. 
Something’s not right. How could a simple cook be able to hack this well 
without any sign of previous experience?
“I’m going in.”
Ledford stopped short of taking another draw on his cigarette and turned 
to Jason. 
“Are you insane? I just told you that anyone who goes through those doors 
is dead. I called you up so you could tell me what we’re dealing with here, 
not to storm the fucking place.”
“Listen Dave, it’s possible that something much bigger than a simple 
killing spree went down here. I don’t know what it is yet, but the only 
way we’re going to get any real answers is if someone goes in there and 
takes this guy down without killing him. Since I’m the only person here 
with the encryption knowledge to counteract the virus, it looks like it’ll 
have to be me.”
Ledford scowled and turned back towards the building. He stood there 
for several minutes, taking nervous draws from his cigarette and glancing 
back at Jason every once in a while. Jason remained rooted to his spot 
next to the car, staring unflinchingly at Ledford. Finally, Ledford hurled 
his cigarette to the ground and stomped on it in frustration.
“Fuck!” He turned back towards Jason, “Fine, go kill yourself for all I care. 
Just know that if you get into any trouble I won’t risk any of my men to 
bail you out once your inside.”
“Thanks Dave. I knew you’d see it my way” 
Jason waved a small salute behind him as he walked towards the main 
entrance. 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automota (Short fiction) 137
The gun slid out readily from its holster–a double action revolver, 
chambered for .357 Magnum cartridges with a four inch long barrel and 
nickel finish. It was a good gun; accurate, never misfired. Jason cocked 
the hammer and pulled the gun closer to him as he pressed himself up 
against the door. He had been waiting there for a while, but the extra 
time was necessary to implement the proper encryptions that would keep 
the virus from affecting him. He had to be careful; there was something 
different this time. 
A line of text appeared on Jason’s HUD. Encryption process complete: 
advanced viral protection systems operational.
Looks like it’s time to go. Open. 
When the door slid open, Jason rounded it with his revolver drawn 
while his mind scanned the entire area for possible threats. But there 
was nothing moving in that room, nothing alive at all. The bodies were 
slouched in their seats with plates of cold, unfinished meals still set out in 
front of them. Even the crystal glasses of water next to their plates hadn’t 
been disturbed when they died. There nothing of immediate danger in 
the room so Jason stepped into the restaurant and the door closed shut 
behind him. One of the corpses was laying face forward on the ground 
near the entrance. 
Must have been that woman’s husband.
Jason leaned down, grasped the man by his shoulders and turned him 
around. Jason’s eyes widened. The man looked as if he had been left to 
starve weeks ago; his skin was leathery, stretched tightly against his jagged 
skeletal frame. Both his chest cavity and his cheeks were completely 
sunken. When Jason dropped him against the marble floor his withered 
body made a hollow, rattling sound.
As Jason proceeded to the center of the dining area he made a check of 
each body. 
Bones. Just bones and ragged pieces of skin. The virus must have amplified 
their artificial metabolisms until they all starved in a matter of seconds. 
All of these victims are customers though. Where are the staff members?
Jason could hear something now. A dull knocking sound, coming from 
the back kitchen. It was barely there but Jason’s augmented ears picked it 
up. 
Thok thok thok thok thok
Jason moved softly down past the tables and took cover near the bar. On 
the other side there was a pair of double doors leading into the kitchen, 
one of which stood slightly ajar. The knocking sound was getting louder.
Thok thok thok thok thok
138 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automata (Short fiction)
With his gun drawn at arm’s length, Jason looked though the doors. All 
he could see were the vague motions of someone’s arm moving up and 
down over a table in the far corner of the stainless steel room.
Zoom in.
Jason’s vision blurred for a moment and then magnified, bringing the man 
into full view.
There you are.
Robert Koch stood there in a dark blue double breasted jacket and apron 
with a butcher knife in his hand, continually chopping away at something 
on the table in front of him. Jason couldn’t quite make out what it was 
though; the entire table was cluttered with several piles of bowls and 
plates. 
Why would he be trying to cook anything? Jason edged closer to the door, 
making sure he was still clear from view. I guess I’ll figure it out soon 
enough.
With a solid kick the double doors flew open and slammed with an echo 
against the side of the walls. Jason rushed into the room with his gun 
aimed squarely at Robert’s head. 
“Don’t move! Police!”
Robert stopped mid cut and looked calmly over at Jason. 
“So they finally sent someone.” He wiped his knife off on his apron, 
“Good, this would have started to get boring if I had to do it alone.”
“Drop the knife. Drop it right now.”
“Oh I will, but first don’t you want to see what I’ve been making here?” 
“I told you to drop the knife.” Jason took a step forward and saw what 
was lying on the table, “No…” 
Mutilated body parts. Ground bits of lung and liver. Soup bowels filled 
with a couple of hearts and stomachs, basting in their own visceral fluids. 
Winding strips of intestines were heaped in mounds upon a trail of plates. 
The remains of a partially diced spine on a chopping board. There was a 
man’s head sitting on a silver platter. His mouth lolled open. 
As Jason reeled back Robert raised his knife high and flung it as hard as he 
could at Jason’s heart. With his mind awash in shock Jason’s body reacted 
automatically, dodging the blade as best it could and squeezing off a few 
rounds into the kitchen in one fluid motion. The shots went wide though 
and Robert had already disappeared from the room. 
After Jason had recovered he noticed a sharp twinge of pain spreading 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automota (Short fiction) 139
through his left shoulder. While his body had narrowly avoided any fatal 
lacerations, the knife still managed to wound him somewhat. It was a 
deep gash too; the fat beads of artificial blood had already begun to coil 
down the curvature of his arm, pooling at the edge of his knuckles. 
No time to wait for the nanites to heal it, I need to take this bastard out now.
When Jason began walking toward the door that Robert had ran through, 
he glimpsed at the macabre feast once more. He noticed that there was 
something carved into the decapitated head in the middle of the table. It 
was beginning to scab over but Jason could read it well enough. 
Sic transit gloria mundi
A text box opened in Jason’s HUD and translated it into English: “Thus 
passes the glory of the world”. 
There was no one out in the main dining area of the restaurant.
He couldn’t have gone outside so he must have gone to the upper level.
Once Jason had looked around for a bit he found a small flight of stairs 
off in the back corner of the building. He made his way up little by little, 
carefully trying not to let his boots resound on the wooden steps. At the 
top of the stairwell Jason leaned out tentatively and examined the area. It 
was an extension of the lower dining room, filled with the same tables, 
chairs and a couple of starved bodies as well. However, instead of a single 
large room the layout was a long corridor with a high arched ceiling. All 
of the lights had been turned out and the shades were drawn over the 
windows, making it harder to see. 
Jason’s eyes switched over to IR illumination mode and once again the 
world lit up in a ghostly pallor. As far as Jason could tell there was no one 
in the corridor, but there were four wooden doors along the side of the 
wall that led into the restaurant’s private dining rooms. Jason positioned 
himself in front of the door nearest to him and held his gun out ready. 
Open. The door sprang open and Jason looked in; nothing but another 
table inside.
-Having fun yet?
Jason jumped at the sound of Robert’s voice and spun around expecting 
to see him about to impale him from behind. But there was no one 
there either. Jason realized that the phone icon had been activated on his 
HUD. 
How could he have hacked directly into my phone line in such a short time?
Slowly, Jason moved back out into the hall.
-Who are you working for Koch? Some type of religious terrorist group? I 
know that the inscription on that poor man’s head comes from one of the old 
140 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automata (Short fiction)
papal coronation ceremonies. Is that your little group’s motto?
While Jason was talking he moved in front of the next door and opened 
it. There was nothing inside either.
-I don’t think I would be willing to divulge that information without at least 
knowing the name of the person asking. Would you care to share it with me?
Jason didn’t like this at all. Koch had penetrated his mental defenses far 
too easily–he felt exposed. 
-My name is Jason Graves, now answer me.
-Well Jason, since you answered so quickly I’ll tell you that I’m not affiliated 
with any religious sect and that my reasons for doing this are completely my 
own. 
Jason moved to the next door and opened it. Nothing again.
-What reason would that be?
There was a long pause.
-Tell me Jason, have you ever considered the implications of consumption? 
Jason was barely listening. They always had some kind of weighty 
message to deliver; some sort of insight that made them think they were 
the next messiah. Jason just needed to keep him distracted long enough 
to find him. 
That in order survive by eating one must also be willing to destroy and even…
He slammed the final door open. 
Nothing? Then he must still be… Jason turned around to see Robert 
dropping down from the ceiling right above him. A blade jutted out from 
a seam in the edge of each hand.
“…kill?!”
Jason fell back into the room, barely avoiding Robert’s overhead cut. He 
heard the blade sing as it sailed just inches past his face and rasp against 
the floor when it hit. Robert had landed in a crouch though and was 
already running toward Jason for another strike. But just before he got 
into range, Jason drew his pistol up and fired a round directly through 
Robert’s outstretched hand. It crumpled back, bursting in a rush of sound 
and smoke. 
Robert staggered back for a moment and collapsed onto one of the chairs 
behind him, sending a few plates crashing to the ground below. All that 
remained of his hand were two fingers and some scorched mechanical 
pieces embedded in his wrist. The table cloth was spattered in artificial 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Automota (Short fiction) 141
blood. Robert examined it for a little bit and suddenly smiled at Jason.
“Looks like I could use a trip to the doctor.”
Jason got up slowly with his gun still pointed at Robert.
“It’s over Koch, take down the virus and we might be able to get some 
paramedics in here to save you.”
Robert was still smiling.
“No, that won’t be necessary. I’m through playing with this toy anyway.”
Jason glared at Robert and drew closer to him.
“What do you mean by ‘this toy’ Koch?”
Robert sat up in his chair and looked straight into Jason’s eyes. 
“Koch?”
“Don’t call me that. Call me Mr. Mundi.”
With that Robert brought the blade on the side of his good hand up to 
his neck and slowly drew it across from ear to ear. With a strangled gurgle 
his body pitched forward and tumbled to the ground.
Jason took a seat in one of the chairs across from Robert’s broken corpse 
and watched as the rim of blood gently crept to the bottom of his boots. 
 “Dammit.” 
142 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Unthinkable (Short fiction)
If you lived forever, what would you do with it? Would you travel 
to every country in the world? Would you work to find the cure 
for cancer? Or would you sit around waiting to do something, 
simply because you know you have forever to get around to it? 
Maybe living forever isn’t quite so different from living only a short 
while. According to Aidan Warren Erickson, one of the world’s first 
‘immortals’, it isn’t how long you live, its simply how you live and 
what you live for. 
This story includes some of the concepts we discussed in the Lennox 
seminar—including space migration, life extension, genetic 
enhancement—and the potential social issues that will arise from it. 
My goal was to make the reader think. 
Just because we can do something, should we? Do we really want to 
live forever? If we know we have forever to do something, will we do 
it at all?
T.S. Eliot once famously wrote, “This is the way the world ends, not with 
a bang, but a whimper.” Those words never truly resonated with me until 
this very moment, because I always thought that the end of the world was 
impossible. Today being alive forever is a given. I never thought the end 
would be like this. It’s not nearly as dramatic as I expected it might be, 
but perhaps that is because I stopped living ages ago.
Dannie and I were best friends. We had been ever since we were born. 
Our parents were the co-founders of a technological company that 
changed the world. In 2337
. The two of us were the recipients of a new 
drug that allowed us to live forever. Among other extensive modifications, 
the drug essentially allowed our DNA to function like a cancer cell. See, 
on natural humans, DNA has an expiration date. It begins to erase the 
important bits after it runs out of the useless code called telomeres. This 
helps to trigger the aging process and begins the “shut down” process 
of normal humans. The drug keeps the DNA from “deleting” any of 
the code when it replicates, allowing us to stay young forever. I never 
appeared to age past 25. 
Dannie and I were forever young and forever in love. I had a great family, 
good friends, and everything I could ever possible want or need. For 
awhile, everything was perfect, until the day I lost her but I’m getting 
ahead of myself. My name is Aidan Warren Erickson, and this is the story 
of my life. 
It took Dannie and me about seventy years to realize that we would never 
run out of time. We grew up as normal children running around in 
the sprinklers with our goofy looking swimsuits and fingers sticky from 
popsicles. We went to elementary school and high school with other kids 
who were just like us—kids who were given the money to receive the 
gene therapy. The rich kids
. It wasn’t until we went to college that we 
ASHLEY FUNKHOUSER
“Unthinkable: The last will and testament of Aidan Warren Erickson”
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Unthinkable (Short fiction) 143
met people who weren’t as fortunate. For the most part, they seemed 
just like us, only we were a little stronger, a little smarter, and a little bit 
more perfect. Dannie and I made friends with many of them despite their 
inherent disabilities. 
A young man by the name of David became a close friend of ours. We 
graduated college with him, lived in the same town as him, and he was 
even the best man at our wedding. Dannie and I stood by David’s side 
when he married and had children, which was something we never got 
around to. We saw him care for his family and watched as he grew 
old and fragile. Dannie and I stood hand in hand with his children, 
by that time old enough that they looked like they could’ve been our 
grandparents, as David’s coffin was lowered into the ground, 150 years to 
the day that we had met him during college.
It was then that we realized that we had all the time there is to accomplish 
the things we wanted to, while some people had so little. It was time for 
us to figure out what to do with it.
One night about 200 years later, I was sitting at the counter doing 
some exercises for the Mayan language class I was taking. Dannie came 
storming into the kitchen, slamming the door behind her.
“Bad day?” I asked nonchalantly.
“Not particularly,” she replied airily.
“The door to the kitchen seems to say otherwise,” I remarked pointedly.
“Well, its not like anything particularly bad happened, its just that 
nothing really good happened either.”
“I don’t understand why that warrants abusing the door frame that way.”
“I’m just sick and tired of doing the same exact thing every single day,” 
she lamented. “I’m tired of going to court and sitting across the aisle from 
a hateful, evil person and fighting as hard as I can to see that he can’t ever 
hurt another person ever again, only to turn around and, in a few years, 
be sitting in the same court room across the aisle from the same scumbag 
that I just put away!”
I got up from the counter and went around it to hug her.
“You are doing good in this world Dannie,” I told her. “Lots of the 
people you’ve prosecuted have been put away forever. Hell, some of 
them you’ve destined to a life of work on Ganymede! They’re not coming 
back.”
“I know,” she sighed. “But it just seems like no matter how hard I try, 
there is always going to be another girl who winds up scarred because 
some monster raped her.”
144 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Unthinkable (Short fiction)
“Give it time love, you’ve only been at it for 170 years,” I reminded her. 
“You have forever.”
It doesn’t take long for the motivation you have in your younger life to 
fizzle down dramatically. After 500 years, Dannie and I began to wonder 
what we were doing with our lives, and whether or not it was even worth 
it. Dannie continued with her work as a prosecution attorney and 
became well known all over the world for her success in the court room. 
There wasn’t a lawyer alive who could sit across the aisle from Dannie and 
still feel like he’d win. Her reputation preceded her, and as the years flew 
by, that turned out to be a boon as Dannie lost her drive. She needed that 
extra intimidation factor to make sure that none of the defense attorneys 
ever really brought their “A” game. She never admitted it but I could see 
her losing her drive every day.
It wasn’t boredom that got to her—despite all of the advances society had 
made, crimes continued to get more and more creative—it was that same 
feeling she had so many years ago
. No matter how hard she worked, there 
were still going to be people out there who she couldn’t get rid of. One 
more victim without justice, one more crime unpunished. Dannie was 
never satisfied with being the best – she never measured herself by the 
performance of others. No, Dannie wouldn’t settle for anything less than 
perfect. 
As for me, I became something of a Jack-of-all-trades. I learned 25 
different languages, became a medical doctor and practiced medicine 
for awhile, then went back to school to pursue doctorates in history, 
anthropology, artificial intelligence and music. History was my real 
passion, because, surprisingly, it was this field that challenged my thinking 
the most.
Its funny how the more things change, the more they stay the same. 
Society really hasn’t done much to further society as a whole in the past 
few thousand years. We still have crimes, war, social class struggles, 
betrayal and scandal. We have done a lot to help with personal issues 
though. Life extension, neuroceuticals, eradication of disease. You would 
think that, considering much of our society now has to spend eternity 
together, that we’d at least try to make it a little more bearable to be 
together. Take some advice from an old man, reader, anything you can do 
to benefit society as a whole will eventually make life better for you too, so 
step it up. 
The problem I ran into was essentially the opposite of Dannie’s. My 
problem was complete and utter boredom. I simply ran out of things I 
wanted to do. I used to sit in one of the ancient museums that showcase 
books all the way from the time of Gutenberg’s printing press to the 
cyberspace revolution, when the world was completely plugged in and 
online. It used to overwhelm me, how many things there were to read in 
the world, and I made it a mission to read them all. However, I quickly 
learned that just because you have an endless amount of time to read 
books on the biology of hookworms doesn’t make you any more inclined 
to do so. 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Unthinkable (Short fiction) 145
“Have you ever wanted to go to Mars?” I asked Dannie one day. We 
were sitting on the patio behind our house, enjoying a bright, perfect 
garden on a pleasant Sunday afternoon. 
“Mars?” she replied looking perplexed. “I guess I haven’t really thought 
much about it. Why do you ask?”
“I just realized that it has been awhile since we took some time for 
ourselves, to just see what’s out there.”
“But what about work? And your classes? We can’t just pick up and leave 
can we?”
“Why not?” I challenged. “Its still going to be there when we get back. Its 
always going to be there.”
Dannie grinned at me slowly.
“Okay.”
“Okay?”
“Okay. Let’s go to Mars. I could use a vacation. Go book the tickets 
while I pack. You know what? While we’re at it, let’s tour all of Earth too. 
All six continents – Atlantis, California – All of the underwater cities, 
Antarctica, the jungle, everything.”
“You got it.”
“Let me just take care of a few things first”
“Don’t bother. We’ll take care of them when we get back.”
One of my favorite memories of Dannie is from our trip to the Great 
Barrier Reef. The reef had just recently recovered from all of the oil spills 
and pollution that humanity had subjected it to before it switched over to 
renewable energy. Luckily, it was one of the beautiful, natural areas that 
we managed to save.
At this point, Dannie and I had settled on not going home. While on 
our visit to Antarctica, I made sure that we sold off our house, I dropped 
out of my classes at the University, and Dannie transferred all of her 
court cases to an associate and submitted her resignation. We’d lost our 
head and been swept up in adventure. Every day was something different, 
thanks to the teleportation technologies that were finally implemented at 
the turn of the fourth millennium.
I remember the Barrier Reef because Dannie was completely happy there. 
She was the Dannie I fell in love with, completely filled with the wonder 
that comes from experiencing something new. She wasn’t stressed out or 
depressed because of work, and she was smiling.
146 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Unthinkable (Short fiction)
It was like entering an entirely new phase of life, which was a refreshing 
change since it felt as though we had settled, what with Dannie having 
won her first dozen or so cases and our financial situation being, well, 
stable, to say the least. Our major accomplishments were achieved, 
everything else was just icing on the cake.
These days, anytime I think of Dannie, I picture her as she takes my 
hand and leads me over to a coral reef covered in brilliantly colored fish. 
Not far off the reef, there are a couple of dolphins playing together. I 
remember Dannie swimming over to them and interacting with them 
as if they were old friends. Just Dannie and the dolphins, swimming 
around each other, the dolphins doing flips and even allowing her to pet 
them and be towed around. Seeing the dolphins, just as they were, not 
genetically enhanced or improved, with all of their flaws, was the most 
perfect thing I had ever seen.
I remember the day I stopped living. It was the day that I consciously 
made the choice to say goodbye to Dannie forever. An accident, the 
doctors called it, a terrible accident. It was no accident though. I think 
in the end it was what we were both looking for. An escape. That’s what 
caused us both to behave more and more erratically, seeking out bigger 
and bigger thrills. Finally, in an accident involving hoverboards in the 
Amazon I lost Dannie.
Oh there were was a time that we spent in the hospital while A team of 
doctors tried to patch her up. Physically, they did a great job. Dannie lay 
in that hospital bed with the same sun-kissed smooth skin I was used to 
seeing every day. Her soft, wavy blonde hair spilled over her shoulders. 
All signs of the crash—the bruises, gashes, broken bones—all healed and 
good as new. She lay there sleeping just as peacefully as she had back in 
our home during a long weekend. 
She never did wake up. No, science had yet to perfect the anatomy of the 
brain, a study I’m inclined to believe they never will. There is something 
inexplicably beyond our capacity for logic that resides in the brain, 
something we cannot know through simple experimentation and study. 
Call it the soul if you will, or the mind or whatever it comforts you to call 
it—but that is what Dannie lost in the accident. After that, she merely 
became a vessel. Dannie’s soul had left this world.
After weeks of sitting in the hospital, looking for signs of consciousness, 
the doctors informed me that she would likely never come back to me.
“It’s a very simple process,” the doctor told me. “She’s unresponsive. 
Dannie’s already gone. She won’t feel a thing. Perhaps its time for some 
closure.”
In other words, they needed the bed. Amazonian genetic enhancement 
wasn’t quite as advanced as it was in the U.S. and, well, medical staffs 
down there still have their hands full.
Euthanasia. Like putting down and old, sick dog, they injected Dannie 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Unthinkable (Short fiction) 147
with a substance to stop her beating heart. Any hope of her returning to 
me was swept away.
After that, I’ve done nothing. Hundreds and hundreds of years of 
nothing. What is the point? Nothing is worth the effort.
So to all of you who are reading this, consider the following my last will 
and testament:
All of my worldly possessions please give to some useful cause or other. I 
never got around to having any children to give them to.
As for my body, I suppose you can donate my brain to science. Maybe 
they’ll figure out that piece they didn’t have when we lost Dannie. I 
doubt it though. Heck, give them my heart too. Maybe we’ve been 
approaching this all wrong. Everything else you can scatter along the 
Great Barrier Reef. May as well live out the rest of my usefulness in the 
last place I was truly and perfectly happy.
My dying wish for all of you is to be kind to one another. Love yourself, 
love another, and love everything around you. It is quality that matters 
in this life, not quantity. If you’ve lived well, it doesn’t matter how long 
you live, it’ll be enough. But don’t waste your time because you think you 
have forever. It goes by faster than you think.
Perhaps I’ll see you all on the other side. My only hope is that this pitiful 
existence isn’t all we’ve got. I hope my Dannie is still waiting for me.
Signed,
Aidan Warren Erickson

148 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : A better life (Short fiction)
A better life is set in the year 2100. In this time, three classes exist, the Post Humans, the Transhumans, and the Necessitan Class. The Post-Humans are 
the upper echelon of society, fully bioengineered humans who do not age in 
any way. The Transhumans are the middle-class members of society who can 
afford some biotechnologies but are not fully transformed into Post-Humans. 
The Necessitan Class is the lower-class members of society who can afford no 
biotechnologies and live just as you and I do today. My story follows the life of 
Leana Roxbury, an 80-year-old Post-Human. The story takes place during the 
two days surrounding her 80th birthday. During these days, her childhood 
friend, Bailey Huesner is coming to visit for her birthday party. Bailey and 
Leana have not seen each other for years but keep in contact through e-mail, 
sharing stories and reminiscing about their childhood. When Bailey arrives at 
Leana’s home, Leana is in for a surprise. Bailey is a Necessitan, and cannot 
afford any bioengineering. She looks just as any 80-year-old today would 
look. Having lived in a bubble in her new Post-Human life, Leana is taken a 
back by this realization. She finds Bailey’s visit very eye-opening and after her 
departure, is left questioning whether or not her life is even real and wishing 
for a way out. 
She had always loved the beach, the smell of salt and the sound of waves 
crashing against the shore, burying her toes deep into the cool sand, the 
sun beating down on her skin. As she lay in the sand, not thinking about 
one thing or another, she opened her eyes to see a seagull perched on 
the sand at her feet. Startled, she sat up. The gull remained at her feet, 
unfazed by her sudden movement. She reached her hand out; the gull 
cocked its head to the left, all the while looking into her eyes. Slowly, 
she stretched her arm out towards the gull to touch it; it seemed so real. 
As a girl on the beach in Nantucket, she remembered watching seagulls 
swoop down to the water, catch a fish, then fly back, high into the sky. 
But never had one been so close to her, she couldn’t resist the idea of 
feeling its soft white feathers. As her hand approached the gull she came 
to the realization that she controlled it. She wasn’t really on a beach she 
remembered, she was in her home in Alaska, sitting in the Simulation 
Room as she did every day. This gull would not fly away as long as she 
didn’t want it too, nothing would happen that she didn’t want. Leana 
Roxbury loved the beach, but she hadn’t really been to one in over 60 
years. 
Reality
Suddenly, the beach began to fade away, the waves stopped crashing 
against the beach, the sand started to disintegrate beneath her, the sun 
slowly transformed into a fluorescent light above her, and finally, the gull 
began to disappear. “Leana!” she heard, someone was calling her name. 
“Leana! Honey! Where are you? The party starts in an hour.” It was her 
husband, Caleb. She had almost forgotten about the party. It was Leana’s 
80th birthday and they had been planning the party for a few months 
now. She snapped out of the calm, relaxed state she had been in on the 
beach to answer, “Coming! Sorry I was just getting some sun before the 
RAELLE SMILEY
“A better life”
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : A better life (Short fiction) 149
big day!”
Caleb and Leana have been married for fifty-five years. Caleb came from 
a wealthy family who had come into their money by finding a way to 
make an alternative fuel out of snow. Married in the year 2045, Leana 
and Caleb had moved to Alaska to take over the family business. The 
couple has two children, Lucas and Naomi, fraternal twins who were 
now in their late 40’s. Now, in the year 2100, some things have changed 
since Leana first started her life with Caleb. Biotechnologies have allowed 
for Leana to genetically modify her body and increase her cognitive 
capabilities and health to that of a twenty-five year old. Leana is part of 
the Post-Human Class, the upper echelon of society with the money to 
pay for these genetic enhancements. Two other classes exist in this society, 
the Transhumanist middle class who has the funds to purchase some 
modification technologies, and the Necessitan lower class who live and 
look just as you and I do today. 
This birthday was extremely special to Leana. Not because she was 
reaching 80, which was not much of a feat anymore, and not because they 
had a party planned, but because a very special visitor was coming, her 
childhood best friend, Bailey Huesner. Bailey and Leana had not spoken 
since she moved to Alaska except over e-mail about major life events. 
Leana could hardly wait to see the woman she had once spent countless 
hours with, braiding each others hair, gossiping about boys and planning 
their dream lives. Although they had been distant for some time, Bailey 
was the only person Leana had ever felt a true connection with. Leana 
had saved every e-mail over the years and read them when she felt lonely 
and missed her past life. Suddenly, a knock came on the door. 
The Reunion
Butterflies filled Leana’s stomach as she turned towards the door. She 
swallowed, a lump forming in her throat. As she turned to walk to the 
door, she stopped at the mirror to make sure she looked okay. The same 
as always, brown hair flowing down her back, her makeup perfectly done, 
skin smooth and wrinkle free, she was the image of perfection. As she 
reached the door she could see a hunched reflection outside, she thought 
Bailey must be holding rather heavy bags and swung the door open 
immediately to help. But the woman standing outside the door wasn’t 
Bailey, it couldn’t be. She stood, hunched over, grey haired, her skin 
sagging, an overweight 80-year-old woman, just as Leana remembered her 
grandmother looking when she was a child. 
Leana could hardly believe her eyes. She choked back an exclamation 
of surprise and managed a muffled, “Bailey? Is that you?” The woman 
replied, “Yes! Of course! Leana, how are you? It has been far too long!” 
Still Leana could hardly speak. Why did she look like this, had she been 
living in a hole, had the technology not reached her? Pulling herself 
together, she embraced Bailey, exclaimed her excitement to see her and 
invited her inside. They lingered in the atrium awkwardly for a few 
minutes as Leana searched for the right thing to say. Bailey beat her to it, 
“Happy Birthday, old friend!” She exclaimed, “It is so good to see you.” 
150 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : A better life (Short fiction)
She handed her a small, gold package with a green ribbon on it, “It’s not 
much, but I wanted to give you something,” she said. Leana took the 
package, unable to restrain herself any longer she finally said it, “You, you 
look so...old…I mean…why?” Bailey’s cheeks turned a bright red color 
and she giggled awkwardly. “I’m a Necessitan,” she said, “My husband 
Ted and I don’t have the money to pay for all of these technological 
advances.” Leana couldn’t believe it. Living in an almost secluded 
existence, she had forgotten that there were people who could not afford 
the Post-Human advancements. Feeling slightly embarrassed by her 
comment, Leana quickly changed the subject, “How was your flight?” she 
asked. “Oh, quite nice.” Bailey said. They lingered a minute more, finally 
Leana pulled herself together and said, “I’m so glad you could make it! 
You are making this the best birthday ever. Remember all the birthday’s 
we had together as children?” Bailey smiled, “Of course I do! I could 
hardly contain my excitement when you invited me here. This is going to 
be a great weekend!”
After a short conversation, Bailey and Leana gathered Bailey’s things, 
brought them to the guest room and went to the kitchen where the rest of 
the guests waited for Leana to start the birthday festivities. All of Leana’s 
closest friends were there, the food was delicious, the music was great 
and the atmosphere was lovely…but something didn’t feel quite right to 
Leana. The more she tried to enjoy herself, the less she did. She turned 
to find Bailey; she was talking to one of Leana’s closest friends from home. 
They seemed to be having a good time, Bailey laughing away, apparently 
telling childhood stories about her and Leana. However, Leana couldn’t 
help but notice how old and worn down Bailey looked, especially next to 
all of her bioengineered friends. It just didn’t seem right. 
Until Death Do Us Part
After everyone had left and Bailey had gone to sleep, Leana snuck 
downstairs to the Simulation Room. She walked into the all white, 
fluorescently lit room, took off her shoes, and stood on the cold, hard 
floor. She closed her eyes and thought, “beach, take me to the beach.” 
She began to feel the breeze on her face, she could smell the salt, and 
hear the waves. She opened her eyes and found herself standing alone at 
the beach, it was night now, the sky was clear and full of stars, the moon 
shone down on the water, its reflection flickering in the distance like a 
light about to go out. Leana felt at home. 
This was the only place she could relax. There wasn’t a person to be 
seen, all she could hear was the crashing of the waves. She took off her 
clothes and started walking into the water. The cold waves hit her ankles, 
and then from her calves up to her thighs, then moved up her waist and 
eventually submerged her shoulders. Leana thought, “warmth,” and the 
water became a little warmer. She let her body be caught by the waves, 
lying on her back she looked up at the stars as the waves threw her back 
and forth, back and forth, rocking her to sleep. “Leana!” she heard 
a scream. She thrashed in the water, her feet hitting the sandy ocean 
bottom; she stood up. It was her husband; he had entered the simulation 
room, and seeing her lying in the water motionless, though she had 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : A better life (Short fiction) 151
drowned. “I’m fine! I’m fine Caleb.” “Come here crazy!” he called out to 
her. Reluctantly she swam back to shore. Caleb threw a blanket around 
her and pulled her into his strong arms. They stood there on the beach 
for a moment, not saying a thing. Finally Caleb asked, “How was the 
party? Did you have fun?” “Sure…I mean, yes, it was lovely, thank you.” 
Leana answered, her voice shaking a bit. “Good, well let’s get back to bed, 
it’s not safe Simulating such things alone at night.” Caleb warned, and 
they walked back up stairs together, leaving the beach scene to continue 
on through the night. 
Leana lay in bed next to Caleb, still feeling shaken by the rude 
interruption of her relaxing midnight swim. Although she was tired, 
she couldn’t sleep. Her mind turned to Bailey. She began to wonder 
what it felt like to be so old, to have grey hair and wrinkled skin. She 
wondered if Bailey wished she could be young again, not have to worry 
about her health or wish she could take a vacation. She wondered what 
her relationship was like with her husband. Did they have more problems 
because they were Necessitans, or less? Caleb rolled over in bed. Leana 
turned to look at her husbands sleeping face, the same face she had fallen 
in love with fifty-five years ago and wondered what he really looked like, 
how aged his skin was supposed to be, what color his hair really was and 
how much of it should he still even have? Without Caleb, Leana’s life 
would have been just like Bailey’s, she never had the money to afford the 
things she does now when she was growing up, was she lucky or was she 
missing out on real life? Was it Caleb’s fault her life felt so empty? She 
closed her eyes and tried to remember what her mother looked like at 
this age, her hair thinning, deep crows feet surrounded her eyes, her skin 
adorned with age spots. Sure it wasn’t the clean, perfect image she now 
portrayed, but it was natural, and that was beautiful. Slowly she felt anger 
boiling up inside her. Caleb had changed her life forever; she was stuck in 
this body for the rest of her life, a life that had no end in sight! Why was 
that better, was she really living this “better life” that the Post-humanist 
movement promised? 
Forever Young
The next morning Leana woke up hardly having slept at all and went 
downstairs to see if Bailey was awake. To her surprise, Baileys feeble 
body was already up, bustling around the kitchen, cooking what smelled 
like Eggs Benedict. “Good morning!” she called out when she saw 
Leana enter, “How did you sleep?” “Oh fine,” Leana replied, “What are 
you cooking? You really shouldn’t have done that! I would have made 
breakfast!” “No, no problem at all! I’m just making Eggs Benedict, your 
favorite, right?” Bailey replied. “Yes, you remembered? Wow, it has been 
so long since I’ve had them. Thank you Bailey.” Leana said, smiling 
to herself, remembering how kind Bailey had always been. They sat 
together, eating the delicious food; Caleb came downstairs briefly, grabbed 
a cup of juice and went off to work. After breakfast Leana and Bailey 
reminisced about their childhood for a few hours. Laughing about all the 
trouble they used to get into, joking about how everyone used to think 
they were twins. “That sure wouldn’t happen now!” Bailey said, jokingly. 
“No, I guess not.” Leana replied, feeling slightly awkward. 
152 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : A better life (Short fiction)
“So how did they do it?” Bailey asked, “How do they make you look 
twenty-five again?” “Oh,” Leana stuttered, “I…I don’t really know all the 
technology behind it, Caleb and I did it so long ago, when everything 
had first come out. I remember hearing about it on the news, feeling 
hesitant. Caleb never was though, he called our doctor the day after the 
technology came out and signed us and the kids up for the anti-aging, 
cognitive enhancement package which was guaranteed to make you look 
and feel whatever age you chose. We chose twenty-five because that’s how 
old we were when we got married, Caleb said I was the most beautiful 
woman in the world when I was twenty-five… So, just a few weeks later, 
we went into the lab. I remember it being so cold, everything metal, 
harsh lights beaming down on us as they assessed the work that needed to 
be done. We were in the hospital for a month. They cut open my head 
and implanted something into my brain. They took my skin and injected 
things throughout my whole body, the pain was excruciating. Finally, 
after a month of lying in a black room, only semi-conscious, feeling my 
skin tighten over my body and my brain swell inside my head, I woke 
up a totally different person; I could hardly believe it! I remember being 
so happy, every time I saw myself in the mirror I was nearly brought to 
tears. I was twenty-five again!” Leana concluded feeling a little taken a 
back about her excitement. “That sounds wonderful!” Bailey exclaimed, 
“I mean not the pain and the month of darkness but the change, and 
after only one time?” “Yep, I guess it’s pretty amazing” Leana said. They 
sat for a moment contemplating the story. Then Bailey realized the time 
and insisted she must be going. Bailey thanked Leana for sharing her 
home and her life with her. Leana offered their Teleporter to Bailey to 
get home, hesitantly, she accepted and within minutes was gone. Leana 
found herself alone again. More alone than she had ever felt. She wished 
she had jumped into the Teleporter with Bailey, escaped this fake life she 
lived and joined her to age and die just as people were supposed to. 
 But she hadn’t, and here she was, standing in her atrium again, 
contemplating the emptiness of her life. Reverting to her daily routine, 
she walked towards the simulation room, opened the door and stepped 
onto the smooth sand. Immediately, the sun hit her face and she 
squinted. For a moment she felt at ease again, walked towards the water 
and let the cool waves wash over her bare feet. She reached into her 
pocket and felt the small gold box that Bailey had given her. She opened 
it; inside laid a gold charm bracelet that had belonged to Leana’s mother. 
Her eyes filled with tears at the sight of this small piece of her old life. 
Then she remembered where she was, that this beach wasn’t real. A feeling 
of panic hit her and she could hardly breath. Suddenly the smell of salt 
was suffocating her, the breeze felt like a 40 mile-per-hour gust of wind, 
and the grains of sand were scraping her delicate feet. She ran to the door 
beyond the beach and hit the button, the button that would turn it all off. 
Again, the sound of the waves faded away, the sun began to turn into the 
fluorescent light, the sand disintegrated beneath her and there she was, in 
that empty white room that had once provided her with so much relief. 
She wondered if she would ever feel peace again. She wondered when she 
would die, if she would die. She wondered what was real about her life. 
Finally, she wondered, how can I get out?

vestiges of the past. There are no white picket fences; there are no nuclear 
families, no dinnertime chitchat about your day at work with those who 
love you. The American Dream is unattainable. Money, a mansion, a wife 
and three mistresses, a husband and a robot playmate, computer nannies 
for the kids with dinner cooked up by the house itself. School, Work, 
Competition, these are our loves.
Our bodies stay strong thanks to the nanos- thanks to The Server. It’s 
our lifesaver. It’s what lets us keep up the competition. Those little nanos 
run through our bodies playing fix-me-up every time we step out into 
the sunlight. Skin damage? NO! Oh, the nanos noticed that you stepped 
outside before you’re designated Out time this morning, why was that? 
Were you violating your Restrictions? There’s an unusually high level of 
serotonin in your blood this evening. Did you overspend your Enjoyment 
time today? You know what that does to productivity! That’s three days 
Enjoyment Free for you! 
I saw that you were engaging in sexual activity outside of your allotted 
reproduction time. You learned in school that sex complicates things- that 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Ahh! Real zombies! (Short fiction) 155
sexual relationships lead to a conflict of competitive interest. You could 
argue the case that the act was competition in itself, but they can see those 
love chemicals in your body, and they won’t let you get away with it. 
You don’t want to be connected to The Server? Try living without the 
nanos. Here’s the catch- you can’t. That atmosphere isn’t going to sustain 
you. Those diseases are going to attack your body so hard. Decades 
without need of an immune system- the nanos will just take care of it. The 
machinery is a necessary part of us. 
There are enclosures for those who choose to go without- but they’re not 
places that anyone would want to live. Thousands of people all shoved 
into one air locked living centre on the outskirts of town. Clichéd as ever, 
keeping in pattern with human civilization. Push those miscreants out to 
where they can’t bother us with their sensitivity anymore. Ingrates who 
would rather suffer then accept the necessity of technology. They think 
they’re “happy”. But the government knows better. The Server says that 
“happiness” is not the ideal state we think it is. Because, as they’ve proven, 
happiness does not a productive society make.
And that’s what it’s about, right? One hundred and sixty years apiece on 
this chunk of earth. No more, no less. One hundred and sixty years to live 
and then, true to style, a lethal injection. Until it ends. 
Theodore Foster was the end of the Server Society. Theodore Foster was 
the death of the United States of America. Theodore Foster has shown the 
world what happens when you let technology rule your life, and let the 
government rule technology. 
This story starts with the technological revolution of the 2050’s. 
When the first nanoneurochines were created (that’s an entire machine 
approximately one nanometer in size) and tested in the brain of the ever suffering lab rat. Of course, it was found that these little magic machines 
could be sent out and used to take care of business inside the body. And 
of course those little lab rats were the first ones to realize the dream. 
Unfortunate. But after ample testing, the technology was found to be safe 
enough to test on the real target—the human being. Scientists realized 
that the nanoneurochines could be used to fix any ailment that could 
possibly plague the body. They were little all-purpose doctors that could 
be used to keep their hosts damage-free for the duration of their time in 
the body.
By 2070, the nanoneurochine was a staple in human healthcare. Nanos 
programmed to could do pretty much anything be injected into the 
bloodstream. But injection into the blood stream means that we must be 
aware of the ailment to bring about the cure. This led to the production 
of another life changing piece of technology- the nanoneurocomputer 
(NNRC). This device was placed at the base of the brainstem, and could 
intercept and interpret all signals that pass through. All NNRC devices 
were connected to a government run wireless server, in which every piece 
of medical knowledge was stored, in addition to the health records of 
every citizen connected to The Server. All information intercepted by 
156 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Ahh! Real zombies! (Short fiction)
the NNRC is sorted and stored in The Server. As the NNRC registers 
information, The Server responds with corresponding information on 
how to program the nanos. If one stays in the sun for too long, nanos 
are sent to the skin to repair the damage done by the UV light. If a toe is 
crushed, the nanos are programmed to encourage cell growth and provide 
support as the bone mends. If you eat spoiled food, the nanos can get 
rid of it before the symptoms are even present. If you ingest an illegal 
substance, the NNRC can tell exactly what type, how you ingested it, and 
exactly how to counteract it and incapacitate you until the authorities 
can be alerted. If you overstep the amount of happiness the government 
deems allowable for the most efficient society possible, the nanos can be 
programmed to block the creation of the chemicals that bring about your 
happiness, and instead provide you with the motivation to work harder to 
earn your happiness back. But you don’t even have to know any of this is 
happening. It’s like… magic. You accept the way things are, as we all do.
Emotions are dead. After decades of oppression, they have sunk back into 
the brain with no hope of escape. As long as The Server tells the nanos 
that emotions aren’t allowed to show their volatile faces, they are banished 
into the depths of the mind. Server State citizens are programmed. They 
make decisions throughout the day, yes, but if they come close to making 
the wrong decision (one the Server deems to be wrong, that is), they can 
be stopped. Stopped before they even knew they were going to make a 
different choice. Love is no longer an issue.
The family unit has been decimated. Family bonds create contentment, 
which create a lull in motivation for work. Of course, this is not to be 
tolerated. Mothers are assigned to children to create an optimum growing 
environment. Children attend boarding schools until they are through 
with their education and living on their own. Parentage is carefully chosen 
in hopes of creating the most intelligent, efficient, contribution to society. 
They’ve figured out how to engineer the perfect child for each role that 
needs to be filled in society. Children are no longer born in the Server 
States, they’re bred. Bred to do what they’re told, bred to excel at their 
given jobs, bred to perpetuate the government’s control over it’s people. 
Theodore Foster was the product of the most public parentage choice 
in American history. The government set out on a decade long search to 
find the most intelligent individuals in the nanotechnology and computer 
science fields. They held aptitude competitions across the States in pursuit 
of a man and a woman who could pass on their abilities to the next 
generation. Computer Scientists and Nanotechnologists from across the 
country clamored to prove themselves, and achieve the ultimate reward 
for their hard work—being chosen by the government to publicly produce 
the Server States’ next idol. After much deliberation, two were chosen; 
genius level nanotechnologist Howard Werkblatz, and equally brilliant 
computer programmer Michelle Carson. They were heroes. The best and 
the brightest in their fields, dedicated to their work, idolized by those they 
worked with, and chosen by the government for the most publicized child 
engineering campaign ever to be had. 
So Theodore Foster was bred, born, and idolized. He entered society on 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Ahh! Real zombies! (Short fiction) 157
in a flurry of excitement tinged with the highest of expectations, and 
stayed suspended in that cloud for the duration of his life. He was the 
exemplification of what it meant to be a citizen of the Server States. He 
excelled at school—as was to be expected. Throughout his schooling, 
Theodore surpassed his teachers in his abilities. He scored perfectly on 
every test he took, never considered enjoyment until he had finished 
his societal duties, and felt his most contentment and happiness after 
completing his work. He was the perfect citizen. 
During high school, when most students become unruly and difficult for 
the government to control, Theodore stayed immersed in his education. 
His enjoyment hours fell by the wayside as he soaked in as much 
information as he could about his subjects. He knew he was created for 
a reason—creating a new, more efficient NNRC. Gotta translate those 
electrical impulses from the brain even MORE quickly. Make society one 
slick machine, working out the kinks before the kinks even know they’re 
going to be kinky. This was what Theodore was brought into the world to 
do, and this is what he dedicated his time to working towards. Theodore 
Foster was a government wet dream in the form of a charismatic, 
dedicated young man. 
By the age of 28, which in the Server Society is barely considered 
adulthood, Theodore had achieved his life goal. He had created a new, 
more efficient nanoneurocomputer. The government granted him the 
most gracious gift they wanted to offer (for gifts do not make an efficient 
society), and allowed Theodore to be the first to test out his new creation. 
After all, who better to test it out on then the very man who created it?! 
But of course Theodore doesn’t see it this way. For him, being the first 
with this new technology is his ultimate achievement. He has created 
ultimate efficiency, and cannot wait to be a part of the future. 
The insertion of a nanoneurocomputer is a dangerous task. Though once 
the computer is installed, one is completely protected from the elements 
(past beheading, or other instantly fatal occurrences), but in the interim 
time between the preparation for insertion, removal of the old hardware, 
and installation of the new, the body is a giant sack of vulnerability. 
Insertion rooms are the only places in the Server States that are required 
to be 100% sterile at all times. If a disease can infiltrate the body during 
the time where the nanos are out of commission, that body will be 
infected immediately and has very little chance for survival. The utmost 
care must be taken in the room’s preparation, and the sterilization of every 
person present for the procedure. In the time of the nanos, the diseases 
that have been cured and left to float throughout society, gaining strength 
and resilience as new cures are created for the nanos to keep the body 
safe from harm. Consequently, though Server citizens never succumb to 
these illnesses, their lands are wrought with powerful diseases that pack a 
whollop. 
On the day of Theodore Foster’s insertion, in the excitement of the golden 
boy’s ultimate achievement, someone forgot to wash their hands. Though 
under regular circumstances Server watchers would notice this oversight, 
even the government was anticipating the day’s events and wasn’t paying 
158 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Ahh! Real zombies! (Short fiction)
enough attention. So, as the States’ team of best inserters worked on 
giving Theodore the first access to his new technology, infection worked 
itself into the brain stem. The area surrounding the NNRC became 
inflamed and unresponsive to the technology. The computer wasn’t 
receiving any signals. The infection was spreading. Years of reliance on 
the nanos to do the jobs of doctors had lead to an almost complete 
eradication of the profession. There were ways to treat illnesses such as 
these, but to gain access to them, one must venture into no-mans land: 
The Bubble States. 
There are always those who question government. The Bubble States 
not only opposed the government, but the ruthless advancement of 
technology at the cost of humanity and a fully functioning nature. 
With the ability to heal from anything, and government control of the 
mind, The Server State population let the planet and it’s health fall to 
the wayside. Waste plants that contaminated the drinking water were 
no longer an issue if the nanos could fix you up right away, right? The 
Bubble-goers of the Sterile States disagree. Their compounds are enclosed 
in what looks like a giant bubble- hence their derogatory identification 
as Bubble-goers. The bubble keeps their society safe from the disarray of 
the Server States. Life inside the bubble is natural. There are no brainstem 
computers, or nanos, or government mind control. They coexist with 
one another, occasionally feeling sad, angry or jealous. More often feeling 
happy, content, and fulfilled. They know the choice they’ve made—to 
live a shorter, more dangerous life in payment for their freedom. Server 
citizens have been bred to believe that their way is the only way. Bubble goers see the truth: The Server government is using its population to 
further it’s global standing and acquire as much monetary gain from it as 
possible. Nothing else matters. To the Bubble-goers, this is the blackest 
form of blasphemy. The sacrifice of emotion and control far outweighs 
any benefit of health once might receive. They view the Server States with 
a sort of hostile disgust. But their rejection of the nanos kept alive the 
only thing that could help poor Theodore Foster: healthcare. 
The Sterile States still functioned like the societies of old. Though 
technology had advanced greatly over time, humanity prevailed over 
machine and the human essence was kept in tact. Doctors were still held 
in high esteem, now with the ability to cure any disease, for it was their 
research that had provided such extensive information for The Server. The 
relationship between Sterile and Server States walks a thin line between 
cooperation and outright hostility. Both societies openly disapprove of 
each other, but must work together to preserve the peace in place of the 
warfare that would ensue otherwise. The government stays out of Bubble 
affairs in return for medical information. This was Theodore’s only hope. 
With next to no immune system, and no doctors available in the Server 
States, the government was forced to place its most valuable citizen’s life in 
the hands of the Bubble-goers. But not without warning.
Without the nanoneurocomputer and the control of the nanos, 
Theodore’s mind would be unguarded for the first time in his life. 
Emotions, free from their nano oppressors, would fling themselves 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Ahh! Real zombies! (Short fiction) 159
back into use with a force strong enough to drive a man insane. So they 
warned him of the danger. Of the emotional influx. Of the ways that 
these emotions cause problems in life, regardless of how great it may be 
to finally feel them. Emotions make for an inefficient human. Who wants 
that? The Bubble-goers. They’ll tell you their way is right, and that you’re 
being controlled. They just don’t understand. They don’t realize that this is 
the right way. They don’t realize that they’re living like heathens; dying so 
young, their bodies decaying, emotions running rampant. No efficiency 
there. So don’t listen to them, they know not of what they speak, 
Theodore. You understand the importance of control and efficiency. You 
are the model citizen. All you have to do is heal and come back, so we can 
re-insert your NNRC and get back to life as it should be.
And so Theodore found himself in a hospital room on the other side of 
the bubble. People were so strange there… Theodore was witnessing old 
age for the first time. Old age and… some strange feeling he couldn’t put 
a finger on. He felt it in his chest… in his stomach… but it wasn’t an 
ailment. It was a sort of ache. A dull throb. His heart beat more intensely 
as the nurse approached him with his next dose of medicine. She noticed, 
as his EKG spiked the second she walked into the room. Theodore was 
confused. He’d seen beautiful women before- much more beautiful 
than this one—but had never responded in such a way. Emotions. 
He remembered what he had been told. Evil, manipulative emotions. 
He closed himself off immediately. The nurse smiled kindly, injected 
Theodore’s medicine into the IV, and walked out of the room gracefully. 
This confused Theodore. Where were the heathens he had been told 
about? These people seemed civilized enough. They were kind to him, 
never accosting him about the evils of his society as he had been told they 
would. Theodore felt another strange feeling rise in his chest, this time 
more soothing. Emotions. Evil emotions? They don’t seem so bad… 
The Nurse entered again, carrying a tray of delicious looking food. 
Another fallacy fed to him by the government- they had told him the 
food would be horrible! As the nurse handed him the tray, he noticed a 
nametag. LuAnne Simmons. Theodore feels that uncomfortable feeling 
in his chest again and cannot resist the urge to ask her who she is. Which, 
you would think, would be obvious, but in Server Society is always the 
first question one asks of a stranger. It is important to know the status 
of another when interacting with them in the most efficient manner. 
LuAnne shares: She is a Nurse at the Simmons Hospital, where Theodore 
has been taken. Yes, the Simmons of her last name is the Simmons of 
the Hospital. Her father is a doctor, and her mother… never mind her 
mother. Theodore doesn’t need to know that her mother is the most 
influential anti-Server activist in all of the Sterile States. Theodore doesn’t 
need to know that LuAnne is the second most influential anti-Server 
activist in the Sterile States. Instead LuAnne smiles kindly again, offering 
information about her childhood in the Bubble, sharing how amazing the 
clean air and green grass can be on a warm summer’s day. LuAnne shared 
the story of her first love—a boy who died after a Server State citizen 
attempted to infiltrate the Bubble. 
160 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Ahh! Real zombies! (Short fiction)
Theodore begins to feel a mixture of strange pressures in his chest again. 
This time both pleasant, jarring, and… strangely… melancholy. He’d 
heard of melancholy before, but to feel it was a whole new animal. He 
found himself wanting to reach out and touch this beautiful, heartbroken 
woman. Heartbroken. This could never happen in the Server States. 
Nothing is ever broken! But this other feeling… this light, feathery, 
uplifting one. This was something Theodore could get used to. He felt 
himself start to embrace it. 
Theodore and LuAnne grew close during his time at the Simmons 
Hospital. They shared much about their lives. Theodore explained in 
detail the society in which he lived—something he would never have been 
able to do while still under the control of The Server. In his explanation, 
Theodore made a realization. This control was not natural. Though this 
may seem like a blatant fact to those on the outside, for Theodore to 
admit this to himself proved something important: embracing human 
nature will always prevail over technology and control. He felt for the first 
time. He felt happiness at the prospect of being able to stay like this, he 
felt anger for being deceived, and for his people’s entrapment in the rut 
he had the unfortunate good luck to escape. He felt warmth for LuAnne, 
and her kind smile. He felt love for the sun, the grass, the birds, and the 
earth. Theodore felt human. Theodore felt natural. Theodore felt the need 
to make a change.
During his last days of treatment, Theodore shared his hopes for change 
with LuAnne. She immediately took interest. Theodore was still unaware 
of her ties to the anti-Server sentiment, and took her excitement as 
happiness for his revelation. He was still new at this whole emotional 
shtick, after all. She fed him ideas. No, the government won’t see reason, 
no the people cannot be persuaded when they are being controlled, no we 
can’t shut of the Server—everyone would die. What can we do? 
Theodore can do what he does best: computer programming. On his 
last day of treatment, Theodore wrote up the plans for a computer virus. 
He would install it in the nanoneurocomputer he created, and have it 
inserted as normal. Once the computer connects to the Server—BAM. 
The government can’t steal any information that’s not directly medical. No 
emotional control, no monitoring every citizen’s every move. The nanos 
fix what’s wrong and then go back to the computer, ready for another 
ailment. It was a perfect plan. But LuAnne never shared with Theodore 
how much she truly hated Server Society. LuAnne hated it, and Theodore 
ended it.
There was a glitch in the plan. As soon as the virus got uploaded onto the 
Server, it took effect. But unlike Theodore, the rest of the population was 
not warned about the surge of emotions they would feel. The rest of the 
population was barely even aware of what emotion meant. Yet, all at once, 
they experienced it for the first time. Anger, jealousy, hatred, confusion. 
All felt simultaneously, and passionately. Imagine: every suppressed 
emotion surfacing at once, and you don’t have the slightest idea of what 
is happening. The Server States went from a population of carefully 
controlled quasi-humans to crazed, confused, full humans with no idea of 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Ahh! Real zombies! (Short fiction) 161
what is happening. 
Theodore, having already experienced the emotional rush and not reacted 
in such a volatile manner, was at a loss for what to do. In a fit of passion 
for the life he now felt all should have the right to live, he overlooked the 
fact that a mass scale dip into insanity could cause such massive societal 
disarray. But Theodore could never have anticipated what happened next, 
for he had not planned it to be so. 
In the moments before he returned to his home, LuAnne asked to look 
over his formula for the program he would use to set his people free. 
LuAnne, having spent her childhood learning from her mother every 
possibly way to take down the Server Society, had immersed herself in 
computer science. To better understand the enemy, she always said. So 
in those few minutes of reviewing the plan, she made a tiny change that 
would decide the fate of Server Society.
And so Theodore Foster brought about the end of his people. After a 
few hours of insanity pervading every area of Server Society, the illness 
started. LuAnne had removed the code differentiating between medical 
information and the information used to control. Theodore, in his haste 
to free the minds of his people, overlooked this as he programmed him 
NNRC. Every nanoneurocomputer was made obsolete within minutes. 
The super-diseases that had been bred since the implementation of the 
Server were ravaging the population into a disgusting breed of half-insane, 
disease ridden, confused monsters. The fears of past societies were realized 
in that moment. Zombies can exist. And Theodore created them. 
Theodore, in an attempt to find LuAnne, broke through the sterilization 
chamber separating him from the Sterile State line closest to his home. He 
headed straight for the nearest hospital, for he also needed to be treated 
for the ailments he had acquired without the aide of the nanos. But 
Theodore was a role model. And as soon as the Server population, infected 
with emotion and disease alike, saw him head to the hospital, they all 
followed suit. The Bubble was broken. These infected monsters headed 
straight for the doctors to get healed. But though the Sterile State doctors 
had the cures for the diseases they were accosted with, they did not have 
the time to heal before they were infected themselves. Hospitals across the 
Sterile States were made redundant as every doctor succumbed quickly 
to the barrage of illness brought upon them by the crazed people of the 
Server States. 
The doctors were dead. The Server was infected with a virus. The Server 
Society and Sterile Society alike were heading towards the fate of the 
doctors. Theodore died with his brethren, confused and alone. LuAnne 
had achieved her goal—at the cost of her own people. Reliance on 
technology destroyed the society that created it, and the society that 
rejected it.

ALY MILLER
“Fake”
Dr. Leslie Hamilton stepped back from the table and surveyed her work. 
Lying across the cold, stainless steel surface was what looked to be a 
normal human male. The figure was entirely ordinary looking—his wavy 
brown hair, lanky figure, and laid back attire would not catch people’s 
eyes. His eyes were closed and he lay perfectly still. If someone had 
walked in just then, they probably would have thought he was dead. 
Until Leslie slowly, hands shaking slightly, reached into her pocket and 
pulled out a small device with a red button on it. She took a deep breath 
and squeezed her eyes shut, as though bracing herself, and pressed the 
button.
No loud alarm sounded. Nothing exploded. It seemed as though Leslie 
had been tense and scared for no reason. The only difference was in the 
figure on the table, whose chest was now rising and falling. Leslie’s eyes 
opened warily and a smile broke out on her face as she saw the results. 
She put her hand over her mouth and let out a loud, semi-hysterical 
sounding noise that seemed like it might have been a laugh. She emitted 
the noise again, before bursting into full on, glee-filled laughter. The 
figure opened its eyes, blinked a couple of times, and turned to face 
Leslie. 
Leslie just shook her head, tears forming at the corners of her eyes. 
“You’re alive,” she finally managed to say, staring at the man in 
wonderment. She spent a few more minutes just shaking her head and 
laughing, her own way of celebrating. The man simply stared at her, 
unmoving apart from his blinking eyes. When she finally composed 
herself, she stood a little straighter, pulled a pencil out from where it had 
been tucked away in the bun her hair was tied up in, and gave the figure 
a smile.
“Hello, Adam,” she said. 
The man who Leslie called Adam was not human. He was, for lack of a 
better term, a robot, although a highly advanced one. Leslie had been 
working secretly and tirelessly to create artificial human life—Adam was 
on all surfaces a perfectly normal human. Tomorrow she would wake him 
up, with his personality and fake past in place, and would set him out 
into the real world. She would follow him, observing how he acted and 
responded to different situations. The purpose of Leslie’s little experiment 
was to ensure that he was predictable—she wanted a robot that she could 
understand, control. 
Adam continued to stare, just blinking his brown eyes. Leslie sighed 
and opened her mouth as though to say more, but just ended up waving 
her hand as though to say not to worry about it and walked over to her 
computer. There she sat, fingers poised over the keyboard, ready to record 
what had happened that day.
Leslie slept restlessly that night, excited for the next day. She had shut 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Fake (Short fiction) 163
Adam down for now, but she couldn’t stop thinking about him. The 
breathing simulation had worked. He was responsive. He knew to look 
in her direction when she talked. He’d done similar things and been on 
multiple times before, of course, but never when he was complete. Never 
before he was ready to have his personality put into him. Before she 
knew it, her alarm was buzzing. Normally, Leslie would groan and hit 
snooze for a good thirty minutes longer. Not this morning.
On an average day, Leslie had no trouble getting dressed in the morning. 
She usually had nobody to impress; she lived in her lab, which she owned 
privately with money earned from previous work. Money was no issue 
for her. Because the lab was her home and her entire life for the past 
three years revolved around perfecting Adam, she didn’t get out much. 
She ventured out maybe once a week, to get groceries or other supplies, 
and when she did she never really talked to anyone. Instead, still in 
scientist mode, she would often simply observe the world around her and 
the interactions between different people, sometimes making notes on 
her phone of different fashion or other trends for input into Adam. Thus, 
she did not put much effort into her appearance. She was once conscious 
of how she looked; she once had friends who she would go out with; she 
once was a social person. Now, she could easily and correctly be summed 
up in one term: scientist.
Today, as she stood in front of her wardrobe, she hesitated. Today was a 
special day. She settled on a pair on black slacks she hadn’t worn in years 
and a nice green blouse. She surveyed herself in the mirror, amazed at 
how different she looked from the last time she’d worn these clothes. 
She looked…old, the clothes fit her a little tighter than they had last 
she wore them, and for the first time she noticed just how pale she was. 
She sighed, knowing she would have to settle with her appearance, and 
walked downstairs to wake Adam.
Adam was lying exactly as he had been the night before. Leslie put on 
a lab coat, both for an air of authenticity and so that later while she 
followed Adam he wouldn’t recognize her by her clothing, plugged a 
thick cord into the sole of his left foot, where a socket that she would 
later conceal was located, and stood by her computer, fingers poised over 
the mouse. With one last deep breath, she pressed the button to upload. 
Adam remained perfectly still, eyes still closed, for a few minutes while 
the compressed data Leslie had assembled was put into Adam, making 
him into the quasi-person she had created. When the computer gave 
a small ding to let her know the process was complete, she unplugged 
Adam and pulled the device with the button out once more and pressed 
the button. This time, instead of gradually awakening, Adam’s eyes 
snapped open. 
“Hey…so um…am I done now?” he asked, giving Leslie a wary look. 
She felt a surge of pride, watching his facial muscles move accordingly as 
he talked, admiring the fact that he could form sentences and accurately 
react to social situations. She was so busy admiring her creation, she 
almost forgot to respond. She snapped out of her reverie as Adam spoke 
again: “Um, sorry, excuse me, but…” he said, trailing off at the end of 
164 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Fake (Short fiction)
his sentence, just as Leslie knew he would. He was programmed to be 
indirect, shy, and a little awkward around people, very unlike Leslie who 
was much more blunt and direct. 
“Yes, you’re done. Now get on, and you’ll receive your check in the-mail,” 
Leslie said, trying to sound professional and to keep any excitement 
out of her voice. Her experiment was going perfectly so far. Adam was 
reacting to situations exactly as was expected, and the fake memories 
she had tirelessly created for him were obviously functioning well; she 
had inputted a recent memory for him of deciding to go donate some 
plasma for a little extra money, explaining why he would be waking up 
in a lab. Of course, the actual process of donating plasma was completely 
different, but Adam didn’t know that, and Leslie hadn’t been able to 
come up with a better explanation to input into him. 
“Um, thanks, I’ll, er, be going,” Adam said, giving Leslie a sheepish 
smile before heading out the door. As soon as the door shut behind him, 
Leslie began running around the lab, gathering supplies. She grabbed a 
notepad, her phone, her camera, her laptop, a jacket, a different shirt to 
change into in case it seemed like Adam was beginning to recognize her, 
and threw her lab coat off somewhat haphazardly, not noticing or caring 
when it fell to the floor, which seemed very out of place in her otherwise 
spotless lab. She picked up her bag, walked across the lab, and opened 
the door.
The first step into the outside world, as always, was a bit of a shock. It 
took her eyes a couple minutes to adjust to the brightness of it all, and 
to how many people were around. She knew the first place Adam was 
heading today, his apartment, although after that she would have to be 
able to see him to predict what he would do next. Leslie could predict 
how Adam would likely react to different situations and what he would 
want to do, although she was not able to say what he would be doing 
at, say, 3:45 next Tuesday. She could tell you which restaurant he would 
likely be at if she knew he was going out to eat, but she couldn’t know for 
sure when he would be going out, or with who. He could not be entirely 
predictable; that was the point of artificial intelligence, to allow the 
machine a degree of flexibility and the ability to analyze situations and 
make their own assessments and decisions based on that. However, the 
entire experiment Leslie was conducting at the moment revolved around 
ensuring that there was a degree of predictability to Adam. 
Essentially, she wanted to ensure that while she didn’t know exactly 
what he would be doing at all times or be able to predict everything, she 
needed to be sure he didn’t do anything completely unexpected. Before 
she introduced her technology to the world, she wanted to ensure it 
would be safe. The entire time she created the experiment, no matter 
how many parameters or safety features she included in Adam, images of 
a robot apocalypse, of them surpassing humans in intelligence, of them 
taking control ran through her mind. She imagined Will Smith having to 
go save humanity, like in I,Robot. She might have been paranoid, but she 
figured that it was better to be safe than sorry. Plus, with test data, she 
would have a better chance of getting a good buyer for her technology, a 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Fake (Short fiction) 165
buyer she could really trust. 
Leslie headed to her car and drove to Adam’s apartment complex where 
she parked across the way, at the building across from his, giving her 
a clear view of his apartment from the outside but sitting far enough 
away that he wouldn’t notice her. Her windows were tinted so nobody 
could see into her car and see what she was doing. She climbed into 
the backseat to be more comfortable and settled down, opening her 
laptop and double clicking on the live video feed she could access from 
the cameras she’d set up in Adam’s apartment. She had bought Adam 
the place a week earlier and gone over there to get it set up, putting 
things the way Adam was programmed to like them, and setting up 
discrete cameras all over the apartment. Adam was made to be relatively 
unobservant, which she hoped would carry far enough for him not to 
ever discover the cameras. But with them, she could observe his behavior 
in his apartment. She saw him sit down at his table and pour himself 
a bowl of cereal before devouring it, leaving the box of cereal and a 
Cheerio that fell off the spoon on the table, something Leslie itched to 
go clean up. Unlike Leslie, Adam was programmed to be rather messy. 
He sunk into the couch and turned on the TV, flipping channels. Leslie 
watched him do so through a camera facing the TV, so she could at least 
watch it along with him and not be too bored. After about an hour, 
Adam turned the TV off, stretched, and gathered up a stack of papers 
from a nearby table. Leslie smiled to herself; it was time for Adam to get 
a job.
Leslie had, years ago, back when she still had a social life, encountered 
a man who made fake documentation for a living. He was probably the 
least reputable of her social circle, but he was a useful connection to have. 
She’d called him up a while ago and purchased many kinds of paperwork 
for Adam to make it easier for him to get a job. She’d also equipped him 
with many of the basic skills he would need, although she did ensure that 
he still seemed young and inexperienced. She wanted him to seem like a 
very average, recent college graduate to the employers.
The first place he went was a bank, where Leslie had set up an interview 
for him that he remembered setting up himself. He shuffled in, 
stammering that he was here for his appointment, before walking into 
the interviewer’s office. As he neared the office, he looked calm, cool, and 
collected until you looked at how he was gripping the folder he’d brought 
with him containing his resume and other paperwork he needed to apply 
for the job. Leslie knew he was racked with nerves, and would probably 
stutter and stammer through parts of the interview. But, she knew he was 
qualified for the job he was applying for, of working with their computer 
databases. Leslie had decided to give him a background in computer 
skills, as it was something she herself knew about, so she wouldn’t have 
to learn a new skill set to program into him. Leslie stood in the lobby 
of the bank, pretending to peruse brochures, her eyes darting up to 
glance at the office door every couple of minutes. After what seemed like 
forever, she saw Adam leave the office, shaking the interviewer’s hand 
enthusiastically with a wide smile on his face. Leslie knew he must have 
gotten the job. She watched as Adam climbed into his car and, thinking 
166 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Fake (Short fiction)
nobody was watching, pumped his fists in the air. She walked outside 
as he began to crank up the radio and roll the windows down—just as 
Leslie would expect—and drove off. 
At this point, Leslie knew several places Adam might go, but Adam was 
reaching the point where she couldn’t say exactly what he would be doing 
at all times. Therefore, she quickly got in her car and began to follow 
him, being sure to be careful not to be noticed while still keeping track 
of him. She had a tracking device in his car, so if she lost him it would be 
OK, but it was easier if she could just keep up. 
Adam ended up going back to his apartment. Leslie couldn’t say she was 
too surprised, in his mind he had just moved in to his new apartment 
and the new city a week ago. He didn’t really know anyone in town yet, 
so he didn’t really have anywhere to go celebrate with people. Leslie 
watched from her car again, this time parked farther away, next to a 
different building in the complex so as to not arouse suspicion, as he 
grabbed a beer from his well-stocked fridge and settled down to watch 
TV again. Leslie watched him until he made his way to the bedroom, 
readying himself to sleep, and then started up her car again. It was time 
for her to go back home, she would quickly review how he slept in 
the morning before beginning another day of observation. The day of 
following Adam around, constantly on edge that he would do something 
out of the ordinary, of being around so many people, had tired her out. 
She let out an audible groan, at the realization that every day for the next 
six months, how long she planned to observe Adam before telling the 
world about him, she would have to do the exact same thing. Hopefully 
Adam would make some friends soon, and it would all get more 
interesting.
Over the course of the next few months, everything went according to 
plan. Adam began to make some friends at work and fell into a pretty 
clear routine that made Leslie’s life in observing him easy. He would 
wake up, go to work, eat his lunch at one of a few places near the office 
with some of his colleagues where they would laugh about things that 
had happened that day, go back to work, finish up, either go out for 
drinks with some friends at a local bar that had happy hour until 7 or 
head back to the apartment to relax by himself, and then go to bed. One 
thing Leslie did begin to notice was that Adam’s personality was starting 
to evolve a bit—he was becoming less shy about opening up to others, 
about initiating conversations, and about breaking from his routine. 
He began to go out with his friends more and more, although he still 
spent a solid half of his nights in his apartment by himself, relaxing. 
Leslie continued to follow him, taking precautions to blend in as much 
as possible and changing clothes often so she would not be noticed. She 
didn’t mind most of it, although the one activity she didn’t enjoy was 
when he went out for drinks with his friends—Leslie would usually sit at 
the bar and order something non-alcoholic for herself, but as a woman 
alone at the bar, men would sometimes come over and try to charm 
her. Some were men she might have once been interested in, many were 
not. But regardless, her priority was Adam. No matter how wistfully 
she might watch some of them walk away after she would bluntly 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Fake (Short fiction) 167
inform them she was not interested, no matter how much some of them 
persisted, she figured she would have time for that later. But it made her 
feel lonely, knowing that she was rejecting all these people while Adam, 
who wasn’t even a real human, was laughing with his friends at their 
usual table. Leslie felt he was better at being human she was.
No new groundbreaking developments occurred over the course of these 
few months. That is, until one day, while sitting in her place at the bar, 
Leslie could hear Adam telling his friends how he had managed to obtain 
a date. His friends gave him high-fives and Adam acted appropriately 
embarrassed, but she could tell he was proud and reveling in it. Again, 
Leslie felt a pang of jealousy, but shoved it aside. Adam had come a long 
way, but his personality was evolving fairly normally, and he still had 
not done anything out of the ordinary. She was still able to easily predict 
his movements and actions and, from what she could hear of Adam’s 
conversation with his friends, he had acted as nervous and bumbling as 
ever when he was asking the girl out. Leslie was eager to observe this date 
happen, to see how Adam would interact.
The next day was the day of the date. That night, Adam stood leaning 
against the wall in front entrance of the restaurant with his cell phone 
in hand, pretending to look cool and unaffected and busy with a text 
message conversation, but really sneaking a glance up at the door every 
couple seconds, to make sure she hadn’t arrived. He took a brief break 
from his (fake) text messaging session to check his wrist, forgetting he 
was not wearing a watch. He blushed, hoping nobody had seen that 
(nobody had, as nobody cared enough to watch him except for Leslie, 
who was sitting at the bar, absentmindedly stirring her drink while taking 
notes on the small pad in front of her), and returned to pressing random 
buttons on his phone to diffuse the awkwardness of waiting. Leslie was 
rather amused by the whole situation; by trying to be less awkward, 
Adam was actually being more awkward. 
After about five minutes of this, a girl finally entered. Adam’s date, a girl 
he’d met in the elevator at work, was pretty in a very plain sort of way. 
She was very indistinctive looking, which was possibly what attracted 
Adam to her. Together, they made a perfectly average looking couple. She 
looked around nervously, shifting her weight to different feet, before she 
spotted Adam, who was determinedly continuing his fake text message 
conversation and pretending he hadn’t noticed her, trying not to look 
too eager or like he’d been waiting long. Leslie watched as they said hello 
to each other, then watched as they sat down—in a booth, as Leslie 
knew Adam preferred. Leslie watched Adam order chicken parmesan, 
his favorite dish (Leslie’s favorite too, coincidentally) and marked on her 
notepad that everything was going according to her predictions. There 
was nothing that Adam had done so far on this date, just as in every 
social situation before, that she had not been able to see coming. Leslie 
drummed her pencil on the bar and continued to watch. 
The pair seemed to be getting along well. The girl laughed at something 
Adam said, he grinned at her, and the conversation continued. Adam 
talked more and more as the date went on, opening up and becoming 
168 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Fake (Short fiction)
less shy around the girl. The girl proved to seem less and less shy as the 
evening went on. She talked enthusiastically, waving her hands around. 
Adam seemed a bit taken aback at her at times, but overall, they both 
looked happy. As the date ended, Adam walked the girl to her car and 
kissed her on the cheek. Leslie smiled to herself; it was so very Adam for 
him to be so gentlemanly on a first date. The girl smiled and climbed in 
her car and remained smiling as she pulled out of the parking lot and 
began to drive away. Adam did the same, blasting music again from his 
car, a sign that he was happy.
On the ride back to follow Adam to his apartment, something hit Leslie. 
She had been so focused on Adam and how he was experiencing the 
world and things around him, she had never thought about the cost of 
unveiling him for what he was on him, or on the people he’d formed 
relations with. Until this night, Leslie had largely viewed Adam as an 
experiment. As a pet of sorts. It was the kiss Adam gave his date that 
finally made Leslie realize; to her he was a machine, a creation, while to 
everyone else he was a human. A person they were becoming attached 
to, a person they would feel betrayed by when they discovered what he 
really was. This newfound realization made her job much harder. She 
knew she would never be able to stop thinking about this from then 
on, as she observed Adam interact with people. How would they react 
when they found out? Did she really want to watch Adam continue on a 
relationship with this girl, only to a few months later reveal to the poor 
date of his, who seemed so happy at the end of the date, that Adam 
wasn’t real, and was going to be disassembled? The answer was, of course, 
no.
That night, Leslie tossed and turned in her sleep. Nobody suspected 
the truth. Adam had no idea, as far as Leslie could see, that he was any 
different from anyone else. He had acted as Leslie had expected and 
he had never deviated from how he was inherently programmed. Her 
experiment, so far, was a success, and to be honest Leslie could not see 
anything dramatically changing in the next couple months to make her 
experiment not a success. She had done what she set out to do. With the 
technology to create a new person, a new personality, well, to be honest, 
she wasn’t entirely sure what the purpose of such technology would be 
and what it would be used for. She had ideas, of course, but she would 
leave the fleshing out the ideas to the companies wanting to buy. Her 
plan was to hire good, expensive lawyers and have businesses pitch their 
ideas for the technology to her until she found one she liked enough to 
sell it to. But she had come up with the idea for the creation and she 
had done it. She had created life complete with a personality. It was a 
huge milestone in science, in technology, she would receive acclaim and 
recognition and awards…but what Leslie had not truly thought out was 
how it might be a huge step back in humanity. In how people viewed 
each other. What if the general public knew about people like Adam? 
What if many of them existed, integrated into society? Would people be 
constantly paranoid that their new friends, their loved ones, were in fact 
robots? Creations? Artificial personalities? Fakes? Or were they? Were 
they really fake? Adam didn’t seem to think so, and the attachments he’d 
formed were genuine to Adam’s friends and to Adam himself. So even 
Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Fake (Short fiction) 169
though Adam wasn’t human, did that mean he was truly not real? Leslie 
sighed. She didn’t know what to think anymore and she was getting a 
headache. 
She never truly fell asleep that night; her mind was going too fast. Her 
alarm went off and she glared at it. She had no desire to go follow Adam 
today, to see him relaying the stories of his date to his friends, to see him 
interacting with this girl farther, to see him happy. Only to know that if 
everything went according to plan, all that happiness would be gone with 
the revelation of Adam’s identity. But she’d been working at this for so 
long. The ideal situation, on the surface, with the guilt she was feeling at 
the moment was to just let Adam live his life, to never tell anybody. But 
Leslie hadn’t discovered a way to make him age like any other human and 
if he ever got injured, medical professionals were bound to notice that he 
was a machine and lacking things like blood and organs. 
There was no way he could go on living as a human secretly. He either 
needed to be shut down now and the technology destroyed, throwing 
years of Leslie’s work and devotion down the drain, or Leslie would have 
to go through with her original plan and reveal him to the world. 
She rolled out of bed anyway and went to work observing Adam; the 
day was just as heart breaking and terrible as she’d expected. Adam spent 
the entire day smiling and she had to watch him “just happen to” walk 
by his date from last night’s office, although the girl was in a different 
department on a different floor and they both knew he had no logical 
reason for being there. Even at the bar later, when Adam was laughing 
with his friends, an act which had never bothered Leslie before, she 
couldn’t get the idea that the relationship he was with these friends of 
his would end as soon as the revelation occurred. They would feel hurt, 
betrayed, and confused. Some might go on to brag later about how they 
were friends with the first robot; some might genuinely miss Adam’s 
company; some might be scared by the whole experience. Leslie could 
predict Adam. She could predict his reaction to a sad moment in a TV 
show, how he would approach someone he was meeting for the first time, 
what he would order at a restaurant, the kind of people Adam would 
be attracted to for relationships and friendships. These human people, 
though, Leslie could not begin to predict. And that, Leslie realized, was 
the prime difference between Adam and the rest of the world. He seemed 
fully integrated. He seemed like a human. But he never would be. Not as 
long as Leslie knew she’d created him.
That night, as Adam was sitting in his apartment, watching TV before it 
was time to go to bed, he did something unusual. He called the girl. At 
that moment, Leslie made a decision. She couldn’t let this continue. She 
exited her car without a moment’s hesitation, slamming the door behind 
her. She marched up to his apartment on the second floor and banged on 
the door. Adam opened the door a few seconds later, his cell phone still 
held to his ear. “One second,” he mouthed to Leslie, telling the girl on 
the phone that he had to go but he would talk to her tomorrow. Once 
he’d hung up, he turned his attention to Leslie. “Can I help you?” he 
asked politely, looking taken aback to find a strange woman in her forties 
170 Reality Hackers : Transhuman : Fake (Short fiction)
on his doorstep. 
Leslie stared at Adam, at the man she’d created. She’d grown attached 
to him in observing him. But, after everything, it was like he was a 
character on a TV show to her. Because she knew he, like characters, was 
written and scripted and, as much as he seemed real, he just wasn’t. She 
cared about him and about what happened to him, but ultimately, Leslie 
knew, he was fake. It might seem real, but it wasn’t. And the world wasn’t 
ready for it.
Leslie drew in a shallow breath, tears forming at the corners of her eyes. 
She took the phone from a dumbfounded Adam and closed it quietly.
“Goodbye, Adam,” she said quietly. Adam had barely a moment to 
register what was happening before Leslie pulled the device with the 
button out of her pocket. 
“What…” Adam started, but it was too late. Leslie pushed the button. 
Adam’s face wiped of any emotion and his eyes closed. He was gone, and 
it was as simple as pressing a button. He would be remembered as real 
among those who didn’t know, but Leslie knew. A human hadn’t died 
just then. She hadn’t killed Adam. She had just written the character off 
the show.

174 Reality Hackers : Extended : Exploring virtual worlds
Having played around with Aardwolf for awhile now, I must say that I 
have mixed feelings. I really wanted to spend my MMO time with Star 
Trek Online, but I’m saving for an iPad, and didn’t want to spend $50. 
Aardwolf was a bit overwhelming for me. This was not because of the 
game’s scope and scale, but simply because it was text-based. I still 
remember my first Gameboy, and spending countless hours playing Tetris. 
Even then, games incorporated a graphical interface, a control scheme 
that uses arrrow keys to move the cursor, icons to represent items, and 
visually realistic worlds that convince us suspend our own realities and 
immerse us in the game.
Aardwolf is a throwback to a previous era, and for many people this is 
great. There are still people that prefer a command line interface on a 
computer to modern graphical user interfaces (GUI). I am not one of 
these people. 
Aardwolf made me do something that games don’t normally do: it made 
me think about how to play. After a relatively short period of time, 
control schemes for modern games have become familiar, almost second 
nature. This effectively eliminates the controller that separates the gamer 
from the game, and we become a part of what we see on screen. 
This essential component of enjoyment never existed for me in Aardwolf. 
Having to constantly think not about “what spell should I cast?” but 
rather “how do I cast a spell?” made the game very frustrating.
I realize that Aardwolf is a throwback to the beginning of virtual worlds, 
and the games have come a long way since Richard Bartle’s original 
MUD. Though I have never played World of Warcraft, Everquest, or Star 
Trek Online, it is clear from what I do know that they embrace modern 
game design principles. Though they are certainly more complicated than 
the average single player game and offer a higher level of customization, 
they use familiar graphic interfaces that allow players to become a part of 
the virtual world in a way that Aardwolf and similar text-based MUDs 
can’t.

“Living in a virtual world”
A friend of mine has been trying to get me intoWorld of Warcraft for 
almost two years now. Despite all of her persuasive efforts, I never saw the 
appeal. The game required too much memorization (something I hate), 
and the virtual relationships built with other players seemed like little 
more than an evolved chat room. 
Recently, I asked her to play for a while so I could observe the game. 
Then, she graciously let me take the controls for about an hour. 
Compared to the game Aardwolf, WoW is more ‘real’ and open-ended, 
which make the gaming experience more enjoyable and relaxing. In WoW, 
there are a vast amount of options and both visual and aural stimulii. 
Even though WoW is easier and more enjoyable, I still had no idea what I 
was doing. I aimlessly jogged around my little forest kingdom looking for 
people to talk to for a good chunk of the time. It reminded me of Zelda
(Nintendo 64 version, one of the best!) when I played as Link searching 
around for quests… except in WoW I was this terrifying goblin woman 
who was running into trees. 
The biggest difference between Zelda and WoW isthat Zelda’s characters 
were driven by artificial premeditated intelligence, whereas you’re 
actually interacting with other people in WoW. It was really awkward 
communicating with the other players in WoW, because I couldn’t get past 
the fact that they were real people. I have gathered that awkward people 
like me are probably not the greatest candidates for role playing games 
like this… and I’m okay with that.
After watching for a while, and hearing other people during the game, 
it was really interesting to me that there were dorky sounding guys 
with bulked up avatars, and men playing as female characters. That 
immediately struck me as one of the strange appeals that must lure some 
of the players in to this virtual world. No matter what you look like in real 
life, you are in charge of your physical construct in WoW in order to give 
yourself the optimal playing advantage and social experience. I find that 
people are very accepting in this type of virtual world, as far as ‘accepting’ 
goes when there is no face-to-face contact or serious interaction.
Overall, I don’t think I’ll ever be the gaming type, nor will I pick up on 
the frenzy any time soon. I’m somewhat awkward in social situations 
that push norms and create new boundaries because I place a lot of 
value on communication. Although I am completely accepting of new 
technologies, I like face-to-face interaction.
I have faith in our media, I’m just weird when it comes to chat-room type 
environments. Games like WoW and Aardwolf are very much for people 
who are able to engage themselves deeply in their own imaginations and 
who are able to explore new means of communication. I see the appeal, 
but don’t think it’s a type of reality I could ever identify with.

Aardwolf reminded me heavily of my high school days playing Dungeons 
and Dragons. While neither are inherently lame, I have a hard time 
imagining things while playing, so they become quite lame.
Often both games boil down to “Vague story for five minutes. Tedious 
boring combat for an hour. Vague story for five more minutes. Tedious 
boring combat for an hour.” I respect Aardwolf for what it does but have 
no desire to return unless I’m showing it to some seriously drunk friends.
Needing another game to play, I moved back to Aion: THE TOWER OF 
ETERNITY. (I feel that subtitle is worthy of being typed in capital letters 
as if it is being announced by someone really manly and awesome) A 
friend is testing out a private Aion server (this means it’s everything in the 
game, minus official servers and mods, plus unofficial mods, minus paying 
for it monthly, minus a bunch of people, including gold spammers) so 
I visited his server. Though I wasn’t playing with any more than three 
people at a time, I have to admit, the time I did spend in there with them 
was as much fun–or more fun–than when the world was filled to the brim 
with people.
Now, let’s get some things straight.
First, the game was incomplete. In fact, most of it did not work. My 
brother got a blue screen whenever he attempted the necessary ascension 
quest, the Abyss didn’t work, and other game mechanics (such as 
enchantments and stigmas) did not work at all.
Second, everyone playing was an administrator. What does this mean? It 
means whatever the players want, we get. Any monster. Any item. Any 
title. Any person. Any place. This is why I enjoyed it so much.
Now, the incompleteness of the game kinda sucked, because characters 
did not have advanced skills and could not function at optimal capacity. 
The abyss is arguably the most fun area, and it was broken. 
However, the administrator privileges made the game absolutely amazing. 
As soon as I could, I promoted myself to fiftieth level, gave myself a 
million bajillion zillion gold, added all the best gear for my class, included 
all the enhancements I wanted, and threw in healing potions guaranteed 
to bring you back to full health. My brother and friends all did the same. 
And then the fun began.
We spawned huge monsters and small monsters, visited enemy capitals, 
and traveled wherever we wanted. It was everything I ever wanted to do in 
an MMO all wrapped into an hour.
That was awesome. We were all in Ventrillo, which is a free Voice Over IP 
client, laughing and having a great time. Getting to hang out and mess 
around with friends and family in an MMO (note this great sound byte

that makes it sound like my parents actually do cool things.) and doing 
whatever we wanted felt so much more interesting than being confined by 
a restrictive game.
This server was running off my friend’s computer rather than a dedicated 
box. I cannot wait until the server eventually goes up for real. There will 
be fewer people, increased rates for experience and loot, and a closer 
community. 
I hate playing MMOs normally, because I ‘m fairly shy online, and it takes 
too long. For this reason, I’ve never integrated well in MMOs, which 
makes them rather boring for me. Exploring a community server, rather 
than the official server, is much more fun.
The friends I made on other games will stop by to visit now and then. 
With the boosted rates, it won’t take forever to level up and be awesome. 
And, because of the size, there will be fewer people farming monsters. 
In the end, I really enjoy persistent worlds as long as they’re fairly small.

So after my less than ideal experience with Maple Story, when I was told 
to experiment with another virtual world, I decided to go with something 
a little less 2D. Now, seeing as I own a PlayStation 3, I decided to try out 
the Home application included on the console. I had messed around with 
friends on it before, but I decided to try going a little more in depth with 
what the program had to offer.
Now to those who aren’t familiar with Home (and in all honesty, that’s 
probably a good thing), it’s like Second Life on a console with more 
advertisements for video games. I would not have bothered with it if it 
was not free and already on my system. My experience with it until this 
point had primarily consisted of having my avatar run up to random 
groups of people and performing the running man dance. I can also have 
him do the cabbage patch or the robot, but the running man is always 
dependable. Tonight, I decided to see if I could actually carry out a 
conversation with other people online.
I started out by sending my avatar to the main plaza area. When I made 
my avatar a few months ago, I designed him to be morbidly obese 
and gave him a greasy hairdo, tons of freckles, a sleazy mustache and a 
unibrow. Most people try to make themselves look better online. I just 
think it’s fun to make my avatar look funny. It also makes me stand out. 
However, it seems that funny-looking people are ignored in cyberspace as 
much as they are in real life. No one wanted to talk to me, and whenever 
I approached anyone else, I would not really get a response. So after 
performing the running man in front of different groups of people, I left 
to rethink my strategy.
I decided to make my avatar less pudgy and more in line with Playstation 
Home standards. I chose a premade avatar. He did not have greasy hair, 
a creeper mustache, nor a unibrow. Where’s the fun in that? When I 
returned to the plaz, I thought I would have more people who would 
want to talk with me. 
Instead, I was greeted by a guy with shades and a large beard who asked if 
he could perform an R-rated act on my character. I declined, because:
 a. PlayStation Home is meant to be a family program, thus 
rendering said R-rated acts logically unfeasible, and 
b. he was a freaking creepy guy with a beard and my avatar does 
not go for that kind of thing. 
He went on his way, and I went back to my old standby: the running 
man. After dancing for a few minutes, a few other people joined in 
and soon we had a sort of dance party going on. This was good, and 
I managed to have a minor conversation that consisted primarily of 
“Running man rules!”

but with more beards. In the film Gamer 
(Neveldine & Taylor, 2009), players 
control real people as if they were 
avatars in a gameworld. The above images

the similarity to Playstation Home on the

However it wasn’t long before everyone left and I was alone again. I tried 
talking to a few other people, and had a few more short conversations, 
but there wasn’t anything substantial. What could I do to get people to 
maintain a conversation with me? 
I went back to the character creation space and decided to try one last 
thing. I made my character female.
And that did it. 
By doing this I discovered the key to PlayStation Home. Apparently, the 
majority of players are teenage boys so desperate for action that they flock 
to anything that even slightly resembles a girl. Apparently this includes 
avatars. 
People walked up to my avatar to introduce themselves and I could reply 
with any crap from the suggested word pool (such as “e.g. we should wait 
in the store to wait in the store in the store”) and I would get interested 
responses. However, as is the law with PlayStation Home, the sketchy 
players reappeared. If I thought the R-rated acts suggested to my male 
character were messed up, well—I got off the program pretty quickly. I’m 
just hoping Chris Hanson comes and busts some of these guys. 
To sum it up: if you want to have a decent conversation online, 
PlayStation Home is not your best bet. If you want to interact with sketchy 
individuals, go right on ahead. Think of PlayStation Home as being like 
Society from the movie Gamer, but less people die and more apparently 
bisexual men with shades and large beards ask for digital R-rated material. 
As for me, I might actually miss Maple Story.
On second thought, no,
 I do not miss Maple Story. 
I do, however, miss the sense of innocence I used to believe still existed in 
this world.

Well? I spent some time exploring more of the Aardwolf MUD. I’ll have 
to say, not being able to “see” exactly what I’m doing is kind of frustrating. 
I’m already slightly video game impaired, so it’s just a little frustrating.
What also throws me off a little bit about this text-based stuff is that it’s 
this weird combination of things. It’s a fantasy novel of sorts (which, I 
mean, I really like. Fantasy novels, I mean) combined with a video game.
This is a really cool concept, but the combination of the two causes a 
disconnect for me. If I wanted to sit and read paragraphs of description, I 
would sit down and pick up a book. 
It would be better if the descriptions were shorter and they would just get 
to the point. I found myself thinking during training, “Okay read, read, 
read, are there dummies in this room? No? Okay, then where are the exits 
so I can find more dummies? Read... read... dammit where are the exits?” 
Perhaps if I had a little more patience, I would understand that it was like 
a story that I could make up as I go along. And that would be cool. It 
would be like a fantasy story in which I was the author. 
I tried thinking like that, and it really worked whenever I was going 
through training because there was a point. There was a goal I was trying 
to get to. But I was bored just walking around, not really doing a task or 
anything. I liked having a goal or something to focus on. I feel like if there 
was some over arching theme. Or goal. Like. You must defeat the master 
or boss or whatever. Except, you know, then it wouldn’t really be an 
interactive game. It would just be a video game. Because once one player 
defeats the boss, then he’s dead for everyone else, isn’t he? So I suppose the 
point here is that there’s not supposed to be an end. Thist bothers me in 
general about interactive games, not just text-based ones. I like there to be 
a goal. I like there to be a goal in real life too, I suppose.
Another thing that was weird for me was that because it was text-based 
there were no pictures. Obviously. But I was kind of bummed because, I 
mean. I’m a CENTAUR. A freaking centaur. They’re awesome. I’d want to 
like pick what color my coat was and my mane and tail and my hair and 
facial features. But I could never see how awesome I’d look. It was just like 
“You kicked a dummy!” or “Your kick chopped through a dummy!” 
So there definitely was an additional weird disconnect between my body 
and the game. I mean, even if there was a picture, I don’t know if my 
body would have had necessarily a strong attachment or feeling towards 
the body on the game when it moved, but at least I could have seen how 
the body moved. And, yes, there’s this whole desire of imagination which 
makes it possible for every one to imagine their individual character 
exactly as they want to. But in video games there’s already a disconnect 
between player and game. The computer serves as both a connector and 
disconnector. On one hand, it’s connecting you to the virtual world but 
on the other hand, you’re still not physically and actually in the game 
because the computer is just a mediator.

Also, there are really disturbing pictures of female centaurs when you 
Google them. Glad to know female sexuality permeates fantasy creatures 
too.
As for the actual game itself, I would need a few weeks to totally get 
down. As I was going through the game, I made a list of things to 
remember—commands and stuff—so that when I got to the training 
section, I could remember all of the commands that the “teacher” had 
taught me. And in some ways it was really helpful, but even based on my 
own notes I took, I still couldn’t figure stuff out. Like I could only kick 
the dummies. Why couldn’t I use my axe? My skills showed that I had 
only 1% skill in kicking but 95% in axing. I wanted to use my ax, but I 
couldn’t figure out how. So for my training section of my skills and spells, 
I spent about fifteen minutes wandering around trying to find dummies 
to kick. I don’t really like repetitition so that got boring really quickly. 
All in all, I would have liked the game better if there were at least some 
kind of pictures. Even if there were just pictures of your customized 
person or centaur or elf. Visualization is so important in video games 
because it helps us better connect with with the game. We’re already 
distanced from the world through the mediation of the computer, so why 
distance ourselves even further?
Recently, I’ve started to explore other video games. After discussing how 
I didn’t like Call of Duty or those other stupid shooting games and how 
I wished there were more games that girls could actually get into, my 
boyfriend took my computer and about ten minutes later I had Pokemon 
Fire Red version on my computer. 
No joke. It’s the freaking coolest thing ever. 
Now, instead of watching TV shows as breaks between homework 
assignments (currently working through The United States of Tara), I break 
it up sometimes by playing some good old fashion Pokemon. It’s as if it’s 
on the Gameboy, but I can play it on my computer. 
I have a badass Charmeleon and Mankey and Kadabra, among others. 
I don’t know if it’s the pictures, the satisfaction of accomplishing goals 
whenever I defeat other trainers or the fact that it brings me back to 
childhood when I had to borrow my neighbors’ Gameboy because my 
parents wouldn’t let us have one, but I definitely like playing Pokemon. I 
promised Alex I’d try out Maple Story after I got tired of Pokemon, so that’s 
next on my list of gaming adventures. 
For now, I’m gonna go level up my Mankey.

I’ve been playing Aardwolf on my own for a week or two now and I have to 
say that I’m really enjoying myself. Being somewhat of a gamer myself, I’ve 
always recognized online games as something I might possibly want to get 
into sooner or later but I have never been comfortable with any game that 
would demand a long-term commitment from me to play. 
Games such as World of Warcraft look exciting from the outside, allotting 
players a virtual Valhalla to explore, battle and make friends. However, I 
also know the darker side. Mind numbing repetition, mounting costs of 
online subscriptions and life consuming addictions all make me slightly 
apprehensive when approaching games like these. Nevertheless, I have 
enjoyed Aardwolf’s free, text based alternative to WOW. 
My character’s name is Stetson. I’m a human mind flayer and I’ve just 
reached level twenty four while roaming through quests and slaying 
monsters. At the beginning the text based interface seemed sluggish to 
someone who had spent the vast majority of their childhood playing 
console games with graphics, but—if one persists in learning the 
appropriate commands—these actions become intuitive and streamlined. 
The game has even made me better at typing because I have to spell 
everything I type correctly and fast if I want the desired result from the 
game. Yet, much of Aardwolf still confuses me and I have only yet to 
scratch the surface of everything I am allowed to do within the world.
For me, the biggest draw of Aardwolf is the mindboggling amount of 
variety that it presents the player. During one quest, I came upon a 
monster, killed it and looted its body for items. I didn’t pay much attention 
to what I received at the time, but later I discovered that I had gained 
a shotgun as a weapon that I could use. I equipped it immediately and 
subsequently began to blow away every monster I could find while still in 
a suit of armor. This is when the game really took off for me. I found new 
places to explore such as one map that’s just a giant void in space with me 
floating from planet to planet or an amusement park with rides. 
The enemies are incredibly diverse. For example, I found a purple dinosaur 
named Barney the Loser Dinosaur. Naturally, I had to fight him. Upon 
entering combat I dealt enormous damage to him while his feeble punches 
missed me entirely. Yet, his health never declined no matter how what 
attack I used. I couldn’t hurt him and he couldn’t hurt me. I was trapped in 
a never-ending battle with Barney the dinosaur. Eventually, I had to flee or 
I would have been stuck there forever. 
All of this is only a fraction of my experiences in Aardwolf and even then 
my experiences with the world have been incredibly limited. In short, this 
is by far one of the best games that I have ever played and I can’t wait to 
explore it some more to find out what else this game has to offer. If you 
didn’t make it past the training portion of the game, I implore you to 
give the game a second chance and take the time to explore. I can almost 
guarantee that you will find something you like.

“Girls will be boys and boys will be girls”
Bit by bit, the mainstream is waking up to the existence of digital worlds 
that bring together players from all walks of life. In recent years, FoxTrot, 
South Park and Big Bang Theory have all poked fun at massively 
multiplayer games.
Even celebrities are not immune to the lure of the virtual life. William 
Shatner, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ozzy Osborne and Mr. T. have all 
been linked to the game World of Warcraft. They are not alone. More than 
11.5 million subscribers pay $20 a month for the privilege of entering the 
fantasy-themed world.
But something funny is happening in these on-line spaces. If you were to 
wander through the capital cities of Orgrimmar or Stormwind, you would 
notice an equal number of male and female characters. However, reliable 
estimates suggest that women make up only 16 percent of the game’s 
player base. As games researcher Nick Yee explains, men play half of all 
female characters.
In theory, gender bending should go both ways. Women can easily create 
male characters. Yet, Yee’s research has found that men are eight times 
more likely to play characters of the opposite gender. This means “1 out of 
every 2 female characters is played by a guy, [but] only 1 out of every 100 
male characters is played by a woman.”
Why are so many men experimenting with gender in virtual worlds? And 
why aren’t women doing the same thing?
Some male gamers say that they play female characters because they 
are more likely to receive donations of money and equipment during 
early stages of the game. A few claim that the speed and size of female 
characters provide strategic advantages during combat.
Others rationalize the behavior as a form of voyeurism. One gamer says 
that her male friends say they play female Night Elves because they enjoy 
looking at their highly sexualized bodies. “They might as well have a nice looking avatar who can pole dance,” she explains.
These explanations almost make sense, but they fail to acknowledge the 
intense identification between players and their on-line selves. Game 
characters are not just objects deployed for strategic advantage or for 
visual pleasure. We actively become our characters.
Research shows that typical gamers spend 23 hours a week in the game 
world. Assuming eight hours of sleep each night, this means that one-fifth 
of their waking life is experienced in their on-line bodies.
Clearly, something else is happening here.
From the earliest stages of childhood, society reprimands young men for 
3.11 An experiment in gender ambiguity.
Blogger Lewis Luminos writes that 
s/he regards herself “as transgendered, 
female to male” and—though s/he cross dresses seven days a week—cannot afford 
to make a medical, biological transition. 
Lewis created the Second Life avatar Salo 
(depicted on following page) using a 
freebie female skin without makeup. 
“It’s an odd situation, being transgen dered in SL,” writes Lewis, “because I 
don’t feel that it’s my SL avatar thats 
the wrong gender. My SL gender is right, 
it’s my RL avatar that’s wrong.”
Reality Hackers : Extended : Emergent phenomena in virtual worlds (Gender) 205
displaying gender-inappropriate behaviors. Girls make crafts or pretend to 
be princesses. Boys play with thinly disguised “toy soldiers.”
Today, as the result of years of struggle, girls can express a range of 
behaviors. Barbie can be a doctor, a lawyer, or an architect, and she can 
ride a Harley Davidson. For boys, the possibilities have not changed since 
the 1950s. They can be superheroes, soldiers, robots, or race-car drivers, 
but never mermen or nurses.
When boys attempt to cross the line, they quickly get the message that 
they have done something wrong. Research shows that parents worry 
much more about “sissy” behavior in boys than about “tomboy” behavior 
in girls.
We often think of oppression as something that stems from the barrel of 
a gun, but it is even more insidious when reinforced by subtle messages 
from peers and loved ones. From the schoolyard to the workplace, the 
typical American man hears the same message throughout his lifetime: 
“Boys don’t cry.” “Stop acting like a girl.” “Be hard, not soft.” “Show no 
fear.”
So it is mind-blowing that men choose to play women in on-line games 
at all. Virtual worlds are one of the few social spaces in which men can 
display female-coded behaviors without fear of social persecution. Perhaps 
so many males are playing female characters in Azeroth because this is the 
only place that they can get away with it.
I am not suggesting that World of Warcraft — or any other multiplayer 
world—is an enlightened utopia. Homophobic and racist slurs fly fast 
and furious in the general chat channels, and the level of maturity is a few 
notches below that of a junior-high cafeteria.
It is also important to acknowledge that men who experiment with 
female characters often rely on clichéd stereotypes. At first, they might 
play a hyper-sexualized character who jokes about having a bad sense of 
direction and becoming grumpy during “that time of the month.”
However, over the course of a single year, the average gender-bending 
male player spends approximately 30 work weeks in a female body. It is 
possible—though not guaranteed—that he will encounter new insights 
about gender along the way. For example, he might realize that it’s not 
flattering to be constantly flirted with when wandering through a public 
area.
Ultimately, these digital arenas remind us that gender is a social 
construction. For all of their problems, on-line games allow men to 
explore these issues with unparalleled freedom. As Richard Bartle, the 
programmer who created the first virtual world, writes: “For me, the 
question isn’t ‘why would people play the opposite to their real-life gender’ 
but ‘why wouldn’t they?’” 
3.12 Lewis Lumino as Salo. “This whole 
experiment has been very interesting,” 
writes Lewis. “Firstly because of how 
surprisingly easy it was to create this 
very androgynous appearance – even though 
Salo is wearing both a female skin and 
a female shape, the appearance is so far 
off what people expect of female that 
other people have assumed male. Which is 
what tends to happen in RL too. So even 
a transgendered female avatar in SL can 
‘pass.’” Lewis’ blog is accessible at:

206 Reality Hackers : Extended : Emergent phenomena in virtual worlds (Grief)
AARON DELWICHE
“Grief and the magic circle”
Several years ago, players on the Illidan server of World of Warcraft 
learned that their dear friend Fayejin had died unexpectedly of a stroke. 
She was described by those who knew her as “one of the nicest people you 
could ever meet,” and her guildmates were deeply saddened to learn of her 
death.
In a short posting to the game’s message boards, Fayejin’s friends invited 
the community to commemorate her by holding an in-game memorial 
near the Frostfire Hot Springs in a zone called Winterspring. “She loved to 
fish in the game,” explained the organizers, “she liked the sound of water 
... and she loved the snow.”
Unable to attend the real-world funeral for financial and geographic 
reasons, the organizers hoped to record the memorial service for their 
friend’s parents. Fayejin had spent hundreds of hours building a life 
within the game, and it seemed important to document the meaningful 
relationships that she had formed on-line.
On the appointed day, dozens of players congregated near the water, 
lining up to pay their respects. Close friends shared memories of the 
deceased, and mourners filed one-by-one up to the water’s edge.
Without warning, a mob of players from another guild descended upon 
the funeral and began slaughtering members of the grieving crowd. 
Paralyzed by a mixture of shock and sorrow, the mourners did not fight 
back. Soon, the area was littered with corpses of funeral attendees.
A few days later, the guild responsible for the attack posted a short video 
clip celebrating the massacre. Combining excerpts from angry e-mail 
messages with game footage and a pulsing soundtrack, the video was 
rapidly propagated throughout the net.
The attack on the funeral was only possible because Illidan is a “player vs.-player” (PvP) server. On such servers, players in contested areas are 
allowed to kill members of other game factions. PvP culture is notoriously 
cutthroat. Some players say that PvP is crucial to their enjoyment of the 
game, while others argue that it enables bullies and psychopaths.
This was hardly the first time that player events had been raided on PvP 
servers. Funerals and weddings for game characters have often been 
attacked by outsiders. However, in this instance, there was one crucial 
difference: The funeral had been organized to commemorate the loss of a 
real human being.
Many gamers viewed the attack as unconscionable. Posting in an affiliated 
message board, a higher-level dwarf asked members of the raiding guild, 
“is there no sense of right or wrong within you? These people were 
honoring a person who is no longer with them, and you attacked them 
while they were unarmed.”
3.13 Mourners massacred on Illidan.

on Illidan. The first image shows mourners 
gathering to pay respects to their fallen 
teammate. The second image shows the first 
wave of the attack.
Reality Hackers : Extended : Emergent phenomena in virtual worlds (Grief) 207
As discussion escalated in on-line forums, many gamers supported the 
guild’s right to attack the mourners. “Oh, good grief,” suggested one 
player. “It’s a PvP server, and you should expect it to happen. Why go on 
a PvP server? To kill and have fun killing helpless people who just stand 
around.”
Defending their actions in public forums, the attackers showed no signs of 
remorse. “I wish I were undead so I could have cannibalized her corpse,” 
wrote one attacker. Another argued that virtual funerals are a ridiculous 
concept. “I don’t log in to watch people celebrating things that happened 
outside the game,” he wrote. “When you sign in, you sign an invisible 
consent contract to be part of that game’s rule set.”
In a follow-up message, the same assailant wrote, “Yes I went out of my 
way to kill stupid people doing something stupid in a video game. I loved 
doing it, and seeing you cry here ... We decided to make a bunch of nerds 
rage out ... cry more dude.”
To gamers and non-gamers alike, the entire incident might seem like 
a frivolous topic. However, conversations about these happenings are 
important. Ethical understandings that emerge from these debates may 
affect the ways that virtual worlds develop in the future. The stubborn 
refusal to contemplate the humanity of players on the other side of the 
network is callous and disturbing.
These games are creating global social networks that pull people together 
across national borders. Even on PvP servers, we have an opportunity to 
augment our compassion, rather than become dehumanized killers.
Ultimately, the biggest losers may be the members of the guild who 
initiated the attacks. As Michael W. pointed out in a recent post to Terra 
Nova, “I mourn the day they lose someone they love, or someone in their 
guild steps out in front of a bus, or whatever. Their actions now mean 
their pain will likely be compounded in the future when they realize both 
what loss is and how they must have made the others feel at the time.”
3.14 Sorry for your loss. The griefers 
reveled in the emotional response to 
their attacks, and they included choice 
comments in their YouTube video.

210 Reality Hackers : Extended : Generation Y ruling the corporate landscape
AARON PASSER
“Our turn: Generation Y ruling the corporate landscape.”
Whether you like it or not games of all kinds are transforming and 
progressing the corporate landscape. Video games today have the ability 
to teach and reinforce specialized skills that allow players to practice 
without the stress of real life failure. Today many surgeons practice 
laparoscopic surgery by first playing simple games like Super Monkey 
Ball that require the same fine motor skills that complex surgeries do . 
Other games are designed to help promote mental agility and wellness. 
In business it is becoming more productive to focus on communication 
and collaboration rather than autocratic direction. Likewise, the most 
popular games of today are those that require teamwork and cooperation. 
Specifically, games that incorporate both social and competitive 
interactions such as Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) can 
be used in the corporate setting to promote collaboration and teamwork 
skills in coworkers. 
Games like World of Warcraft (WoW) encourage and require players to 
collaborate with each other in order to conquer quests that with out such 
cooperation would be impossible. In my personal adventures in WoW, I 
set out to discover how in-game challenges and interpersonal relations can 
be directly translated to foster better communication and problem solving 
skills in today’s corporate world. No longer should games be viewed as a 
waste of body and mind; rather we should continue to utilize social games 
and interfaces to promote and teach skills that are pivotal to success in the 
ever changing business environment. 
Most organizations today do not allow for games in the workplace. 
Employees must scan the environment for superiors, waiting for the 
right moment to get in a quick game of minesweeper or solitaire. If 
caught, employees are told to stop wasting time and get back to work 
(minesweeper got me kicked off the computer for a day at my summer 
internship). Despite this overwhelming attitude towards games in the 
work place more and more “companies are setting up break rooms with 
video games to create a fun office atmosphere and—believe it or not—
increase productivity.” 
As a business major here at Trinity one thing I have learned is that 
interpersonal relationships have the ability to make or break business deals 
and team goals. Video games are a great way for peers to interact with 
each other in a fun and informal way. As Generation Y continues to 
invade the workforce many companies are designing game rooms instead 
of coffee lounges for their employees to enjoy. Keeping morale high in 
the office is key to success, and a game room is a great way for employers 
to provide a fun place to interact with co-workers. 
MMOGs can provide another great learning environment for co-workers 
that is not only fun, but also can help teach important leadership skills 
necessary for continued success in the corporate world. Instances, raids, 
and guilds in WoW have the ability to strengthen relationships and 
teamwork between coworkers that can be used for real life business 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Generation Y ruling the corporate landscape 211
situations. Games are designed to be stimulating, challenging, and fun, 
and that is exactly the type of atmosphere that employers want to provide. 
In raids (large-scale group quests) it is necessary that all players fulfill 
their specific role: whether it is to tank (take damage) or to heal. If group 
members lag behind or don’t do what they are supposed to, the whole 
raid is put in jeopardy. This is also true in the business world. In many 
cases coworkers must work together to accomplish goals, and just like 
in WoW if even one group member falls back on their responsibilities it 
puts the whole group at risk of failure. Quests in WoW are composed of 
challenging tasks that are satisfying to accomplish and are linked to a clear 
mission. Games like these can be used for co-workers to learn how to 
work together to complete difficult goals. 
When participating in instances (small scale raids) I was able to identify 
several leadership skills that are reinforced through the game. The first is 
learning how to pick team members. While participating in an instance 
it is necessary to have players who can take damage, inflict damage, and 
heal other players. WoW now makes this very easy with the “Dungeon 
queue” which searches for other players who are trying to accomplish the 
same instance. Based upon your preferred position in the instance the 
game will pair you up with other players who have chosen other tasks. 
For example if an instance composed of five players has no one who can 
take a lot of damage the group will fail. It is necessary in the game and in 
real life to choose team members with unique skill sets that are necessary 
to get the job done. It may be possible to complete the instance with out 
a “tanking” player, but it will definitely be a lot more difficult. While 
this does make it easy to team up with other people, it doesn’t account 
for players who won’t actually put full effort into the instance. Being in 
a guild is one way to get around this problem because constant player 
interaction helps build trust, which is a key ingredient to success, even in 
the gaming world. 
Planning is also a determining factor for success in both worlds. Group 
members must understand their roles and stick to the plan if success is to 
be had. A famous viral video known to most simply as “Leeroy Jenkins” 
is a good example of this point. In the video a group of WoW players 
are getting ready to do a raid. A few of the players are assigning tasks to 
other players and are planning the attack based on past failures. Leeroy 
Jenkins, one of the players, decides it’s time to run to battle and leave 
behind the others. This causes total panic among the group and in a short 
time causes the death of all players’ involved and ultimate failure. Leeroy 
didn’t stick to the plan and ruined everything for all players involved. In 
business planning is of utmost importance. Time is money, and if you 
don’t have a plan you are probably wasting your time. 
Another key skill is being able to evaluate performance. In WoW this 
can easily be accomplished by checking various gauges that track a 
players performance. This can be a bit more challenging to do in the 
real world, but the idea of monitoring performance of team members is 
vital to uncovering why the group succeeded or failed. Managers must 
be willing and able to deal with underperformers in order to ensure that 
failure does not happen again. Sometimes underperformers simply are 
212 Reality Hackers : Extended : Generation Y ruling the corporate landscape
bad players who don’t care and who should probably not be a part of your 
group anymore. Other times however, underperformance is due to the 
individual wanting to contribute and help, but not knowing exactly how 
to do that. While playing WoW one day a player of a higher rank invited 
me to join his group so that he could help me with quests. We played 
together for almost eight hours that night and he eventually invited me 
to his guild. I quickly learned that the guild I had joined was assembled 
to help lower level players advance more rapidly. Before player Sofedanor 
came to my aid I found myself mostly wandering aimlessly around the 
world trying to complete random tasks. However when I joined forces 
with Sofedanor he gave me tons of hints and tricks on how to improve 
my game play. With out his game play knowledge I probably would 
have eventually found my way, but his sincere help made for a smooth 
transition into an active and contributing guild member. 
WoW in general is a great place to practice leadership skills. Anyone has 
the ability to be a party leader or start his or her own guild. Leadership 
roles in real life may present more pressing matters, but leadership roles in 
video games like WoW have enough parallels to real life that they can be 
used to prepare new workers for management positions in the future. In 
WoW you can lead, organize with others, solve problems, learn, motivate, 
and gain a sense of unity among players. Valuable leadership skills like 
those are important for success in WoW and business. As a member of 
Generation Y I grew up learning through technology so it seems only 
fitting that we continue to use every facet of technology, especially video 
games, to continue our learning. Games like WoW can promote and 
reinforce communities of practice among coworkers, which build strong 
relationships through interaction and collaborative work on problem 
solving. 
In today’s rapidly changing business environment the valuable leadership 
and collaborative skills taught and reinforced in games like WoW are 
more important than ever. The most popular games of today are 
“massive problem solving exercises wrapped in the veneer of an exotic 
adventure.” Games like these are increasingly more complex and require 
players not only to play individually, but also to actively solve problems 
through teamwork and cooperation. Video games have evolved to engage 
rationality and logic skills that can be directly related to real life situations. 
The teamwork and logic skills demanded by MMOGs are the same skills 
that are demanded for success in business, and by harnessing everyone’s 
greatest abilities, raids and business teams are able to work together to 
solve problems where the individual would fail.

MARK MCCULLOUGH
“Faces of Agras”
###### 06:06 ######
Agras woke-up on this rather gloomy pre-dawn Monday morning as if he 
had sprung to life. In an instant he was on his feet, fully-dressed and ready 
to go. Everything seemed normal. Awake and ready to go, Agras looked 
down at his watch to read new messages in his inbox. 
While opening his inbox, Agras made sure to keep a close eye for his 
friends, he didn’t want them to notice his iOMEGA 3. Just last week Agras 
bought an iOMEGA 4, but because he’s so short compared to others in 
his class, he was forced to relinquish the iOMEGA 4, or else. If his family 
or friends were to notice the iOMEGA 3 instead of the iOMEGA 4, then 
they might kick him out of the house, his dad was the military-type: 
unrelenting, unwilling, and unmerciful. Maybe this was good for Agras, 
to have a strong fatherly figure guiding him on his life’s journey; and 
besides, it’s not like Agras is starving, homeless, or worse yet, lost. 
The iOMEGA 3 flashed with vibrant colors: red, blue, magenta, purple. 
An annoying folkish song began to pierce the jet-black walls of Agras’ 
small 20 x 20 parcel of a room. The sound waves filled His ears with such 
piercing intensity that He was left with no other choice but to lower the 
volume, somehow and someway it had to happen and it did. 
Business was usual, the market went down a few percentage points and 
his SPAM folder was filled to the zipper with advertisements for penis 
enlargers and gold. “Delete” He said with a temporary lisp, He continued 
“huh, that’d be so cool, one day, drink beers. HA HA! Yes, Asia, China, 
Asian food, Asian women;” He was unmistakably faded from the night’s 
activities and clearly He had no idea what He was talking about. 
Agras put his free hand down and looked around the room. The dark 
walls were jet black and windows were missing. No sunlight had ever 
shined down into Agras’ room, never. But this didn’t bother him, after all, 
sleeping is always better without light; movies, too. Bored, Agras decided 
to lead himself to the door in the Northeast corner of the room and with 
little effort the door swung open rapidly and crashed into the other side 
of the wall. Apparently this was a usual occurrence as Agras noticeably 
didn’t flinch to the chaotic door. Agras walked down his cobblestone steps 
outside his room when all of a sudden, He got a craving for a cigarette, 
but tobacco went extinct in 2036 so cigarettes were no longer produced. 
As he took his next to last step off the uneven cobblestone steps, his 
iOMEGA 3 once again broke the sound barrier and projected the 
unmistakable sound of new messages in the inbox. Surprised that 
a message had arrived right after He just got through checking, He 
reluctantly opened the message, not even realizing that his family and 
friends might notice the iOMEGA 3. 
The message was from a sender by the name of “Kypolai” from the 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Faces of Agras (Short fiction) 215
Department of Public Affairs. The message was written in CAPS:
DEAR AGRAS,

BEST REGARDS,
KYPOLAI
Grand President, Department of Public Affairs
“What the fuck!” He shouted with rage causing His mother to wake up 
from her early-morning hang over; she stormed down the hall scolded 
Him for His gamer thug talk and rudeness. But seriously, He was right for 
shouting out loud, he was being sent to another planet in exile for his past 
actions. What actions? What did Agras do? What did He do? 
He paused but couldn’t remember anything—who he fought, who he 
talked with, nothing. The smell of His breath told the story, it was tequila. 
With the realization of his utter impairment, He passed-out, and laid 
down in a folded position on His desk.
He shuffled in His dream and eventually fell onto the floor. The sun light 
woke Him up and He grawged and yawned with unprecedented intensity, 
tequila still poignantly in his breath. 
###### 14:41 ######
Agras jumped up off the ground with enthusiasm. He shook off His 
216 Reality Hackers : Extended : Faces of Agras (Short fiction)
impairment, which by now had subsided after the brief nap. He only 
had 8 more hours left until he’d be automatically teleported to the Space 
Migration Station (SMNSN). The Department of Public Affairs has 
jurisdiction over the SMNSN and up until recently, the Station was only 
used for alpha Migrators. These alphas were given the task to explore 
the far off lands and to report back to the Department of Public Affairs. 
Awareness was slim, as nobody seemed to care that new worlds were being 
created every day. Alpha tests confirmed that the far off lands would be 
great depositories for societal dissidents, you know, those who broke the 
rules. 
Looking around, Agras found his transport wrecked into the sidewall of 
his room, luckily the walls were made of material from 2012—when the 
ancient astronauts came back to earth and brought new technology! The 
transporter on the other hand looked nearly totaled, the back left tire was 
split in half from the sharp edge of a decorative boulder. The grille was 
cracked and the manufacturer’s logo became even less intelligible. Not 
knowing how his transport got into the side of the wall but seemingly 
unaffected, Agras jumped aboard and drove off, speeding and peeling 
away in the grass as usual; teenagers these days. 
Agras raced past his neighbors, ones which he never truly knew. The trees 
on the road to the federally run Local Community Center (LCC) were 
hanging well into the street, sometimes in the way of pedestrians or traffic. 
Complaining wouldn’t accomplish much, though. Public Affairs didn’t 
do streets, that was something for the planners and designers. But for as 
long as He could remember, the trees were always hanging in the way of 
day-to-day traffic, that’s just how it was. Looking at His watch He realized 
that his time to exile was approaching quickly; so Agras abruptly turned 
20 degrees to the left in the direction of the LCC; after thinking over the 
exile message, it occurred to Him that it would be most wise to secure his 
personal belongings and items, as well as documentation—couldn’t even 
expect the feds to keep backup copies of legal documents anymore. 
##### 15:15 #####
“Three hours left, shit.” Agras stood at a stand still for a couple of minutes 
patiently waiting for his transport to begin moving again. He looked 
around, a layer of thick pixelated mist floated above the lush grass and 
rolling mounds. It was deathly still outside, not even a breath of wind. 
As He came back from a quick mental hiatus outside, He realized the 
situation was perfect for killing. Agras was jolted forward sharply by his 
near ruined transport, which ironically was still running like a charm, 
equally as fast as always. Hunting involved no smell, only sight. Looking 
over his shoulder He found one, a prime and delicious water buffalo lying 
down in the brush. The transport screeched to an extreme halt 200 yards 
away from the buffalo, throwing Agras off the front end of the buggy; but 
his skills kept him on his feet. 
He was unsure whether the buffalo was asleep or not, but Agras seemed to 
only care about killing. He ran with haste, sometimes so fast forcing Him 
to lag. 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Faces of Agras (Short fiction) 217
He was obviously annoyed and felt no sympathy for His mother who 
was still waiting for her exedrin to kick-in as epitomized by his constant 
bursts of rage, “MEEERHEH! MIERDA! I wonder if everyone has bad 
connections... GOSHH!”
The buffalo was near, and it was definitely not asleep. Agras leaped thirty 
feet with the help of His super boost, traveling through two large bushes 
and falling on top but sliding off of the buffalo. No matter how hard 
He tried, Agras couldn’t get on top of the “stupid dummy” to kill it. The 
buffalo, half the size of Agras, was startled by the attack but kept her 
ground; in the past the buffalo would have ran off in fear because of a 
genetic glitch or something, but once the update came out buffalo no 
longer ran off when bigger enemies challenged it. 
Blood spilled from the buffalo as Agras took his knife and jabbed at the 
buffalo. She was a tough cookie because until she had died there were 
no wounds, it was like she was untouched, “[sic] well I guess they are 
tough animals /shrug” he wrote on his chat journal, linked to His fwitter 
account. 
Agras searched through the buffalo carcass and found 4 gold in its back 
hind. He picked up the gold, as expected, and looked around for more 
buffalo to kill. “C’mon son, what’s up with that shit... how can you do 
shit like that Kanye?” was heard in the background.
“Damn foutube.... jeez.”
It continued, “how you gonna go on stage and do that shit to that little 
white girl? c’mon son...”
He burst out in laughter, obviously no longer paying attention to His urge 
to kill. “Ha! well, c’mon son... I guess I should go to the bar and at least 
get a drink or some potion before the journey. Also need to stop by the 
bank... or maybe I’ll trade platinum for gold with a farmer... I hear gold is 
like literally the universal currency. SOO righteous! ” 
Apparently the likes of “c’mon son” grabbed His attention, forcing Him to 
remember that he was on a time schedule!
##### 15:51 ##### 
He had ventured so far into the forest that Agras couldn’t spot his 
transport. He looked at his iOmega and went to the map function, he 
appeared close to the bar and His experience suggested that he should just 
run, he was fast after all. 
Agras ran at full speed towards the bar, speeding past conversing shamen, 
clerics, and soldiers and pretty much anyone else who was signed in and 
nearby. He even might have passed some friends, but Agras was obviously 
in a hurry and He imagined the others could notice he was doing 
something important. 
218 Reality Hackers : Extended : Faces of Agras (Short fiction)
He could see the bar, perched on flimsy looking wooden stilts high into 
the air. Trees covered the four corners of the bar and an ancient looking 
wooden plank walkway led up to the entrance. As he got to the top, now 
walking on the level porch which went around the outside perimeter of 
the bar, Agras turned and looked north and upwards towards the sky. Up 
there, He thought, was where he was going. 
“I wonder what it’s like. I hope it’s not as bad as it sounds, I mean, being 
a beta is always fun even if shit does go wrong. But that’s definitely their 
reasoning behind the decision, it’s gotta be. I bet I’ll be listed on the 
founder’s blog for the new world at OTULP. That’d be so cool.”
Appearing bewildered, Agras jaggedly looked around and found the 
entrance to the bar. As he swung the door open it once again crashed 
into the wall with unprecedented force and silence—“there was definitely 
something glitchy about these doors,” He thought. Entering the hall, he 
noticed the regulars sitting in their usual, seemingly permanent positions 
at tables just waiting to be talked to. They didn’t mind though, that’s 
just what they did, not everyone had cool, fun, and interesting jobs; not 
everyone was allowed to kill! 
“Nobody interesting today... hmm, how does some milk sound? I do need 
some after the killing and I guess the crash... OH yea! the crash, how did I 
crash anyway?”
As he approached the bar, Agras automatically put down his weapons 
so that he could sit on one of the awkwardly designed barstools. The 
bartender, il dirigente, looked emotion-less as if something had happened. 
Agras got his attention and He ordered some milk to replenish his 
magma. 
“One milk for the recent inquirer,” said il dirigente.
“You sound like a moron...” He said directly to il’s face. But il just stood 
there, looking past Agras and at the back wall of the bar. Il’s stare and 
casual shifting movement made it seem like something was wrong, but 
there most definitely wasn’t. At least there wasn’t a problem that affected 
il, and it’s not like he knew of OTULP or Agras’ punishment, or did he? 
Agras finished the milk in an instant and immediately regained his 
much needed magma. Getting creeped out by il’s lameness, He looked 
around the room, remarking to Himself that it was just the regulars, “... 
noooobody cool.” Time was being wasted anyway, so He decided to leave. 
##### 16:20 #####
By now Agras was halfway to the bank, it was only on the other side 
of Nihiri-platz which was not very far at all. On the way though he 
encountered some interesting characters one stood out from the crowd 
like Tom Cruise at a gay bar; it’s not like he didn’t fit in with the crowd, 
but this crazy man on the corner of Huvin and Nihiri-Strasse just wanted 
way too much attention, he kept screaming over-and-over, “Reeloy 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Faces of Agras (Short fiction) 219
Renkins! Oooohh YES that’s me! REEEEEELOOOOY REEENKINSSS. 
The KNOW-IT-ALL extraordinaire! Ask me anything, DO IT! Reeloy 
Renkins! Oooohh YES that’s me! REEEEELOOOOY REEENKINSSS…. 
“
“What an annoying buffoon… who the hell does he think he is. Reeloy, 
psh, c’mon son.” At that very instant, He knew what He had to do. 
Agras drew-out his knife, and prepared for battle. The obnoxious fool on 
the corner, screaming as loud as he could was going to pay for being such 
a tool. As he quickly approached Reeloy, He noticed that it was coming as 
a surprise to the supposed know-it-all. “This is gonna be too easy!” Agras 
threw all his mass and force into his knife’s blow. The tip of his knife 
soared through the air skillfully slicing a tiny insect in half as if that was 
part of the plan. The knife approached Reeloy. Ten inches. Seven inches. 
Two inches. Right before the sharp edged tip of the knife was about to 
pounce the weak-looking body of the halfling, it bowed to a standstill in 
the air. Reeloy must have had these threats all the time because a forcefield 
surrounding the buffoon prevented Agras from penetrating his form. 
“Do it! C’mon, let’s chat… ask me anything. Only thrrrreeee buffalo 
carcass’ or six copper!” said Reeloy. 
Agras stood there, hilariously stunned, He paused to think and He 
checked his balance. “All platinum and no carcass. Shit.”
After a few minutes of awkward standing, Agras left Reeloy in search 
of the bank. He could see the bank in the distance. It was a hut, made 
of wood, stone, and straw. Rather unsecure looking, but the bank was 
actually impenetrable from direct contact, a thief would have to hack it’s 
mainframe to cause any real ruckus. 
As Agras approached the door to the bank, he was met by a farmer 
who had in his possession ample amounts of gold, platinum, and even 
copper; not even the bank carried copper, it was sort of left only to the 
underground, and Febay. 
The gold farmer approached Agras and offered to conduct a trade at a 
lower interest than the bank. It was sketchy, but He knew that there was 
no other option. Bank tellers could take up too much time, which is 
something He did not have. 
Accepting the offer, Agras traded all his platinum for gold and the farmer, 
rejoicing, gave him seven copper as a token of gratitude, “thank so much!” 
##### 16:51 #####
Kypolai was a brilliant ranger and a loyal member of the Order. His 
long and droopy face could be seen mirrored on his glass desktop. At 
the very moment when Agras traded with the farmer, Kypolai received a 
notification message that He had received another point for “dissenting 
behavior.” 
220 Reality Hackers : Extended : Faces of Agras (Short fiction)
“Who does he think he is?” said the Russian-born Kypolai, “try to mess 
with me, I mess back at you!”
##### 17:17 #####
Unaware of the developments occurring within the walls of the Public 
Affairs building, Agras left the farmer and the bank and enthusiastically /
dance’d his way back to the corner of Huvin and Nihiri-Strasse. He found 
the farmer’s generosity to be an omen, He was curious as to what Reeloy 
had to say, if he knew everything, then he’d surely know of Agras’ forced 
migration and maybe even further details. 
“This is gonna be great, he’s annoying but I have to give him a try, maybe 
he’s part of the new update or something,” He said to Himself. 
As Agras approached Reeloy, He heard an unusually familiar sound, 
“MAIL!!!” He said in a very deep, loud, and obnoxious yet exciting voice. 
“/iOmega.”
Agras looked at his watch and opened his inbox. The sender was Kypolai 
from Public Affairs. When His eyes on the screen read Kypolai, His heart 
dropped. “What did Agras do now?”
He opened the message and noticed it was in CAPS:
DEAR AGRAS,
DUR TO YOUR ACTIONS OF THE PAST FEW MINUTES, 
YOUR EXILE SENTENCE HAS INCREASED. YOU WILL 
BE AUTOMATICALLY TELEPORTED TO OTULP AT 18:18 
HOURS, BYPASSING THE SPACE MIGRATION STATION. 
YOUR HARSHER SENTENCE SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN 
DISTASTEFULLY, OTULP IS FULL OF FUN AND 
EXCITING ADVENTURES AND I PROMISE YOU’LL ENJOY 
IT! SEE YOU SOON!
BEST REGARDS,
KYPOLAI
Grand President, Department of Public Affairs
Completely and utterly befuddled, all He wanted to do now as speed to 
Reeloy to figure out what’s going on—otherwise it would be all over. 
Agras put away his iOmega 3 and continued to approach Reeloy. He could 
hear the annoying buffoon off in the distance.
He could spot Reeloy. Agras drew his knife once again and went running 
through the air. The tip of his knife went soaring towards the heart of 
Reeloy, “whatever, at least it’s fun, even if I can’t kill him.”
Reality Hackers : Extended : Faces of Agras (Short fiction) 221
Agras’ knife stood dead still at the onset of Reeloy’s forcefield. 
“REEEEEELOOOOY REEENKINSSS. The KNOW-IT-ALL 
extraordinaire! Ask me anything…”
“Shut-up bitch…” said Agras right to Reeloy’s face. He looked at his clock 
and realized that time was running-out. In less than an hour, he would 
be teleported directly to OTULP and perhaps Kypolai will bet here to 
great him. He did say in the message after all that he would “SEE YOU 
SOON!”
He clicked on Reeloy’s chat bubble with the click of a mouse. Reeloy 
sprang to life and greeted Agras warmingly. 
“Hello sir,” Reeloy said in a surprisingly normal tone of voice, “how may I 
be of service?”
Agras was instructed by his player Bruce to give six copper to Reeloy in 
exchange for information. Bruce typed in his question, “What is OTULP, 
who is Kypolai, and why and I being exiled?”
“/enter.”
Reeloy took a second to process the information and a smile soon shined 
brightly on his face. Bruce couldn’t help himself but to be excited, he was 
about to finally figure out what has been happening with his avatar Agras. 
As he anxiously awaited Reeloy’s response, His laptop fan began to run 
loudly and rapidly. “What’s going on?! Huh?!?”
In a robot tone, Reeloy gave Agras his answer, “You gave me six copper 
but asked me THREE q-u-e-s-t-i-o-n-s! You are t-er-m-i-n-a-t-ed!”
At that very instant, Bruce’s laptop screen went blue, and at the top of the 
screen read, “Trojan download successful.” 
“NOOOOOOOOOO!” He cried, His mom’s footsteps could be heard 
pounding down the carpet of the hallway leading to his room.
Bruce’s laptop had died, and for the time being, so had Agras.

CORY DOCTOROW
“Anda’s Game”
Originally published on Salon in November 2004, the short story “Anda’s 
Game”has been translated into multiple languages. Cory has graciously shared 
all of his writings with the community via an Attribution Non Commercial 
ShareAlike Creative Commons License.
Anda didn’t really start to play the game until she got herself a girl-shaped 
avatar. She was 12, and up until then, she’d played a boy-elf, because 
her parents had sternly warned her that if you played a girl you were an 
instant perv-magnet. None of the girls at Ada Lovelace Comprehensive 
would have been caught dead playing a girl character. In fact, the only 
girls she’d ever seen in-game were being played by boys. You could tell, 
cos they were shaped like a boy’s idea of what a girl looked like: hooge 
buzwabs and long legs all barely contained in tiny, pointless leather bikini armor. Bintware, she called it.
But when Anda was 12, she met Liza the Organiza, whose avatar was 
female, but had sensible tits and sensible armor and a bloody great sword 
that she was clearly very good with. Liza came to school after PE, when 
Anda was sitting and massaging her abused podge and hating her entire 
life from stupid sunrise to rotten sunset. Her PE kit was at the bottom of 
her school-bag and her face was that stupid red color that she hated and 
now it was stinking maths which was hardly better than PE but at least 
she didn’t have to sweat.
But instead of maths, all the girls were called to assembly, and Liza the 
Organiza stood on the stage in front of Miss Cruickshanks the principal 
and Mrs Danzig, the useless counsellor.
“Hullo chickens,” Liza said. She had an Australian accent. “Well, aren’t 
you lot just precious and bright and expectant with your pink upturned 
faces like a load of flowers staring up at the sky?
“Warms me fecking heart it does.”
That made her laugh, and she wasn’t the only one. Miss Cruickshanks and 
Mrs Danzig didn’t look amused, but they tried to hide it.
“I am Liza the Organiza, and I kick arse. Seriously.” She tapped a key on 
her laptop and the screen behind her lit up. It was a game—not the one 
that Anda played, but something space-themed, a space-station with a 
rocketship in the background. “This is my avatar.” Sensible boobs, sensible 
armor, and a sword the size of the world. “In-game, they call me the 
Lizanator, Queen of the Spacelanes, El Presidente of the Clan Fahrenheit.” 
The Fahrenheits had chapters in every game. They were amazing and 
deadly and cool, and to her knowledge, Anda had never met one in the 
flesh. They had their own island in her game. Crikey.
On screen, The Lizanator was fighting an army of wookie-men, sword in 
one hand, laser-blaster in the other, rocket-jumping, spinning, strafing, 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 227
making impossible kills and long shots, diving for power-ups and 
ruthlessly running her enemies to ground.
“The whole Clan Fahrenheit. I won that title through popular election, 
but they voted me in cos of my prowess in combat. I’m a world-champion 
in six different games, from first-person shooters to strategy games. I’ve 
commanded armies and I’ve sent armies to their respawn gates by the 
thousands. Thousands, chickens: my battle record is 3,522 kills in a single 
battle. I have taken home cash prizes from competitions totaling more 
than 400,000 pounds. I game for four to six hours nearly every day, and 
the rest of the time, I do what I like.
“One of the things I like to do is come to girls’ schools like yours and let 
you in on a secret: girls kick arse. We’re faster, smarter and better than 
boys. We play harder. We spend too much time thinking that we’re freaks 
for gaming and when we do game, we never play as girls because we catch 
so much shite for it. Time to turn that around. I am the best gamer in the 
world and I’m a girl. I started playing at 10, and there were no women 
in games—you couldn’t even buy a game in any of the shops I went to. 
It’s different now, but it’s still not perfect. We’re going to change that, 
chickens, you lot and me.
“How many of you game?”
Anda put her hand up. So did about half the girls in the room.
“And how many of you play girls?”
All the hands went down.
“See, that’s a tragedy. Practically makes me weep. Gamespace smells like 
a boy’s armpit. It’s time we girled it up a little. So here’s my offer to you: 
if you will play as a girl, you will be given probationary memberships in 
the Clan Fahrenheit, and if you measure up, in six months, you’ll be full fledged members.”
In real life, Liza the Organiza was a little podgy, like Anda herself, but 
she wore it with confidence. She was solid, like a brick wall, her hair 
bobbed bluntly at her shoulders. She dressed in a black jumper over 
loose dungarees with giant, goth boots with steel toes that looked like 
something you’d see in an in-game shop, though Anda was pretty sure 
they’d come from a real-world goth shop in Camden Town.
She stomped her boots, one-two, thump-thump, like thunder on the 
stage. “Who’s in, chickens? Who wants to be a girl out-game and in?”
Anda jumped to her feet. A Fahrenheit, with her own island! Her head 
was so full of it that she didn’t notice that she was the only one standing. 
The other girls stared at her, a few giggling and whispering.
“That’s all right, love,” Liza called, “I like enthusiasm. Don’t let those 
staring faces rattle yer: they’re just flowers turning to look at the sky. Pink 
228 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
scrubbed shining expectant faces. They’re looking at you because you had 
the sense to get to your feet when opportunity came—and that means 
that someday, girl, you are going to be a leader of women, and men, and 
you will kick arse. Welcome to the Clan Fahrenheit.”
She began to clap, and the other girls clapped too, and even though 
Anda’s face was the color of a lollipop-lady’s sign, she felt like she might 
burst with pride and good feeling and she smiled until her face hurt.
###
> Anda,
her sergeant said to her,
> how would you like to make some money?
> Money, Sarge?
Ever since she’d risen to platoon leader, she’d been getting more missions, 
but they paid gold—money wasn’t really something you talked about in game.
The Sarge—sensible boobs, gigantic sword, longbow, gloriously orcish 
ugly phiz—moved her avatar impatiently.
> Something wrong with my typing, Anda?
> No, Sarge,
she typed.
> You mean gold?
> If I meant gold, I would have said gold. Can you go voice?
Anda looked around. Her door was shut and she could hear her parents 
in the sitting-room watching something loud on telly. She turned up her 
music just to be safe and then slipped on her headset. They said it could 
noise-cancel a Blackhawk helicopter—it had better be able to overcome 
the little inductive speakers suction-cupped to the underside of her desk. 
She switched to voice.
“Hey, Lucy,” she said.
“Call me Sarge!” Lucy’s accent was American, like an old TV show, and 
she lived somewhere in the middle of the country where it was all vowels, 
Iowa or Ohio. She was Anda’s best friend in-game but she was so hardcore 
it was boring sometimes.
“Hi Sarge,” she said, trying to keep the irritation out of her voice. She’d 
never smart off to a superior in-game, but v2v it was harder to remember 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 229
to keep to the game norms.
“I have a mission that pays real cash. Whichever paypal you’re using, 
they’ll deposit money into it. Looks fun, too.”
“That’s a bit weird, Sarge. Is that against Clan rules?” There were a lot of 
Clan rules about what kind of mission you could accept and they were 
always changing. There were curb-crawlers in gamespace and the way that 
the Clan leadership kept all the mummies and daddies from going ape poo about it was by enforcing a long, boring code of conduct that was 
meant to ensure that none of the Fahrenheit girlies ended up being virtual 
prozzies for hairy old men in raincoats on the other side of the world.
“What?” Anda loved how Lucy quacked What? It sounded especially 
American. She had to force herself from parroting it back. “No, geez. All 
the executives in the Clan pay the rent doing missions for money. Some of 
them are even rich from it, I hear! You can make a lot of money gaming, 
you know.”
“Is it really true?” She’d heard about this but she’d assumed it was just 
stories, like the kids who gamed so much that they couldn’t tell reality 
from fantasy. Or the ones who gamed so much that they stopped eating 
and got all anorexic. She wouldn’t mind getting a little anorexic, to be 
honest. Bloody podge.
“Yup! And this is our chance to get in on the ground floor. Are you in?”
“It’s not—you know, pervy, is it?”
“Gag me. No. Jeez, Anda! Are you nuts? No—they want us to go kill 
some guys.”
“Oh, we’re good at that!”
#
The mission took them far from Fahrenheit Island, to a cottage on the 
far side of the largest continent on the gameworld, which was called 
Dandelionwine. The travel was tedious, and twice they were ambushed on 
the trail, something that had hardly happened to Anda since she joined 
the Fahrenheits: attacking a Fahrenheit was bad for your health, because 
even if you won the battle, they’d bring a war to you.
But now they were far from the Fahrenheits’ power-base, and two 
different packs of brigands waylaid them on the road. Lucy spotted the 
first group before they got into sword-range and killed four of the six with 
her bow before they closed for hand-to-hand. Anda’s sword—gigantic 
and fast—was out then, and her fingers danced over the keyboard as she 
fought off the player who was attacking her, her body jerking from side 
to side as she hammered on the multibutton controller beside her. She 
won—of course! She was a Fahrenheit! Lucy had already slaughtered her 
attacker. They desultorily searched the bodies and came up with some 
230 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
gold and a couple scrolls, but nothing to write home about. Even the gold 
didn’t seem like much, given the cash waiting at the end of the mission.
The second group of brigands was even less daunting, though there were 
20 of them. They were total noobs, and fought like statues. They’d clearly 
clubbed together to protect themselves from harder players, but they were 
no match for Anda and Lucy. One of them even begged for his life before 
she ran him through,
> please sorry u cn have my gold sorry!!!11!
Anda laughed and sent him to the respawn gate.
> You’re a nasty person, Anda,
Lucy typed.
> I’m a Fahrenheit!!!!!!!!!!
she typed back.
#
The brigands on the road were punters, but the cottage that was their 
target was guarded by an altogether more sophisticated sort. They were 
spotted by sentries long before they got within sight of the cottage, and 
they saw the warning spell travel up from the sentries’ hilltop like a puff 
of smoke, speeding away toward the cottage. Anda raced up the hill while 
Lucy covered her with her bow, but that didn’t stop the sentries from 
subjecting Anda to a hail of flaming spears from their fortified position. 
Anda set up her standard dodge-and-weave pattern, assuming that the 
sentries were non-player characters—who wanted to pay to sit around 
in gamespace watching a boring road all day?—and to her surprise, 
the spears followed her. She took one in the chest and only some fast 
work with her shield and all her healing scrolls saved her. As it was, her 
constitution was knocked down by half and she had to retreat back down 
the hillside.
“Get down,” Lucy said in her headset. “I’m gonna use the BFG.”
Every game had one—the Big Friendly Gun, the generic term for the 
baddest-arse weapon in the world. Lucy had rented this one from the 
Clan armory for a small fortune in gold and Anda had laughed and 
called her paranoid, but now Anda helped Lucy set it up and thanked the 
gamegods for her foresight. It was a huge, demented flaming crossbow 
that fired five-meter bolts that exploded on impact. It was a beast to arm 
and a beast to aim, but they had a nice, dug-in position of their own 
at the bottom of the hill and it was there that they got the BFG set up, 
deployed, armed and ranged.
“Fire!” Lucy called, and the game did this amazing and cool animation 
that it rewarded you with whenever you loosed a bolt from the BFG, 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 231
making the gamelight dim towards the sizzling bolt as though it were 
sucking the illumination out of the world as it arced up the hillside, 
trailing a comet-tail of sparks. The game played them a groan of dismay 
from their enemies, and then the bolt hit home with a crash that made 
her point-of-view vibrate like an earthquake. The roar in her headphones 
was deafening, and behind it she could hear Lucy on the voice-chat, 
cheering it on.
“Nuke ‘em till they glow and shoot ‘em in the dark! Yee-haw!” Lucy 
called, and Anda laughed and pounded her fist on the desk. Gobbets of 
former enemy sailed over the treeline dramatically, dripping hyper-red 
blood and ichor.
In her bedroom, Anda caressed the controller-pad and her avatar punched 
the air and did a little rugby victory dance that the All-Blacks had released 
as a limited edition promo after they won the World Cup.
Now they had to move fast, for their enemies at the cottage would be 
alerted to their presence and waiting for them. They spread out into a 
wide flanking manoeuvre around the cottage’s sides, staying just outside 
of bow-range, using scrying scrolls to magnify the cottage and make the 
foliage around them fade to translucency.
There were four guards around the cottage, two with nocked arrows and 
two with whirling slings. One had a scroll out and was surrounded by the 
concentration marks that indicated spellcasting.
“GO GO GO!” Lucy called.
Anda went! She had two scrolls left in her inventory, and one was a shield 
spell. They cost a fortune and burned out fast, but whatever that guard 
was cooking up, it had to be bad news. She cast the spell as she charged 
for the cottage, and lucky thing, because there was a fifth guard up a tree 
who dumped a pot of boiling oil on her that would have cooked her down 
to her bones in ten seconds if not for the spell.
She power-climbed the tree and nearly lost her grip when whatever the 
nasty spell was bounced off her shield. She reached the fifth man as he was 
trying to draw his dirk and dagger and lopped his bloody head off in one 
motion, then backflipped off the high branch, trusting to her shield to 
stay intact for her impact on the cottage roof.
The strategy worked—now she had the drop (literally!) on the remaining 
guards, having successfully taken the high ground. In her headphones, the 
sound of Lucy making mayhem, the grunts as she pounded her keyboard 
mingling with the in-game shrieks as her arrows found homes in the 
chests of two more of the guards.
Shrieking a berzerker wail, Anda jumped down off of the roof and landed 
on one of the two remaining guards, plunging her sword into his chest 
and pinning him in the dirt. Her sword stuck in the ground, and she 
hammered on her keys, trying to free it, while the remaining guard ran 
232 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
for her on-screen. Anda pounded her keyboard, but it was useless: the 
sword was good and stuck. Poo. She’d blown a small fortune on spells and 
rations for this project with the expectation of getting some real cash out 
of it, and now it was all lost.
She moved her hands to the part of the keypad that controlled motion 
and began to run, waiting for the guard’s sword to find her avatar’s back 
and knock her into the dirt.
“Got ‘im!” It was Lucy, in her headphones. She wheeled her avatar about 
so quickly it was nauseating and saw that Lucy was on her erstwhile 
attacker, grunting as she engaged him close-in. Something was wrong, 
though: despite Lucy’s avatar’s awesome stats and despite Lucy’s own 
skill at the keyboard, she was being taken to the cleaners. The guard was 
kicking her ass. Anda went back to her stuck sword and recommenced 
whanging on it, watching helplessly as Lucy lost her left arm, then took a 
cut on her belly, then another to her knee.
“Shit!” Lucy said in her headphones as her avatar began to keel over. Anda 
yanked her sword free—finally—and charged at the guard, screaming 
a ululating war cry. He managed to get his avatar swung around and 
his sword up before she reached him, but it didn’t matter: she got in 
a lucky swing that took off one leg, then danced back before he could 
counterstrike. Now she closed carefully, nicking at his sword-hand until 
he dropped his weapon, then moving in for a fast kill.
“Lucy?”
“Call me Sarge!”
“Sorry, Sarge. Where’d you respawn?”
“I’m all the way over at Body Electric—it’ll take me hours to get there. Do 
you think you can complete the mission on your own?”
“Uh, sure.” Thinking, Crikey, if that’s what the guards outside were like, 
how’m I gonna get past the inside guards?
“You’re the best, girl. OK, enter the cottage and kill everyone there.”
“Uh, sure.”
She wished she had another scrying scroll in inventory so she could get a 
look inside the cottage before she beat its door in, but she was fresh out of 
scrolls and just about everything else.
She kicked the door in and her fingers danced. She’d killed four of her 
adversaries before she even noticed that they weren’t fighting back.
In fact, they were generic avatars, maybe even non-player characters. 
They moved like total noobs, milling around in the little cottage. Around 
them were heaps of shirts, thousands and thousands of them. A couple 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 233
of the noobs were sitting in the back, incredibly, still crafting more 
shirts, ignoring the swordswoman who’d just butchered four of their 
companions.
She took a careful look at all the avatars in the room. None of them were 
armed. Tentatively, she walked up to one of the players and cut his head 
off. The player next to him moved clumsily to one side and she followed 
him.
“Are you a player or a bot?” she typed.
The avatar did nothing. She killed it.
“Lucy, they’re not fighting back.”
“Good, kill them all.”
“Really?”
“Yeah—that’s the orders. Kill them all and then I’ll make a phone call and 
some guys will come by and verify it and then you haul ass back to the 
island. I’m coming out there to meet you, but it’s a long haul from the 
respawn gate. Keep an eye on my stuff, OK?”
“Sure,” Anda said, and killed two more. That left ten. One two one two 
and through and through, she thought, lopping their heads off. Her vorpal 
blade wentsnicker-snack. One left. He stood off in the back.
> no porfa necesito mi plata
Italian? No, Spanish. She’d had a term of it in Third Form, though she 
couldn’t understand what this twit was saying. She could always paste the 
text into a translation bot on one of the chat channels, but who cared? She 
cut his head off.
“They’re all dead,” she said into her headset.
“Good job!” Lucy said. “OK, I’m gonna make a call. Sit tight.”
Bo-ring. The cottage was filled with corpses and shirts. She picked some 
of them up. They were totally generic: the shirts you crafted when you 
were down at Level 0 and trying to get enough skillz to actually make 
something of yourself. Each one would fetch just a few coppers. Add it all 
together and you barely had two thousand gold.
Just to pass the time, she pasted the Spanish into the chatbot
> no [colloquial] please, I need my 
[colloquial] [money|silver]
Pathetic. A few thousand golds—he could make that much by playing 
a couple of the beginner missions. More fun. More rewarding. Crafting 
234 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
shirts!
She left the cottage and patrolled around it. Twenty minutes later, two 
more avatars showed up. More generics.
> are you players or bots?
she typed, though she had an idea they were players. Bots moved better.
> any trouble?
Well all right then.
> no trouble
> good
One player entered the cottage and came back out again. The other player 
spoke.
> you can go now
“Lucy?”
“What’s up?”
“Two blokes just showed up and told me to piss off. They’re noobs, 
though. Should I kill them?”
“No! Jeez, Anda, those are the contacts. They’re just making sure the job 
was done. Get my stuff and meet me at Marionettes Tavern, OK?”
Anda went over to Lucy’s corpse and looted it, then set out down the 
road, dragging the BFG behind her. She stopped at the bend in the road 
and snuck a peek back at the cottage. It was in flames, the two noobs 
standing amid them, burning slowly along with the cottage and a few 
thousand golds’ worth of badly crafted shirts.
#
That was the first of Anda and Lucy’s missions, but it wasn’t the last. That 
month, she fought her way through six more, and the paypal she used 
filled with real, honest-to-goodness cash, Pounds Sterling that she could 
withdraw from the cashpoint situated exactly 501 meters away from the 
schoolgate, next to the candy shop that was likewise 501 meters away.
“Anda, I don’t think it’s healthy for you to spend so much time with your 
game,” her da said, prodding her bulging podge with a finger. “It’s not 
healthy.”
“Daaaa!” she said, pushing his finger aside. “I go to PE every stinking day. 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 235
It’s good enough for the Ministry of Education.”
“I don’t like it,” he said. He was no movie star himself, with a little pot 
belly that he wore his belted trousers high upon, a wobbly extra chin and 
two bat wings of flab hanging off his upper arms. She pinched his chin 
and wiggled it.
“I get loads more exercise than you, Mr Kettle.”
“But I pay the bills around here, little Miss Pot.”
“You’re not seriously complaining about the cost of the game?” she said, 
infusing her voice with as much incredulity and disgust as she could 
muster. “Ten quid a week and I get unlimited calls, texts and messages! 
Plus play of course, and the in-game encyclopedia and spellchecker and 
translator bots!” (this was all from rote—every member of the Fahrenheits 
memorized this or something very like it for dealing with recalcitrant, 
ignorant parental units) “Fine then. If the game is too dear for you, Da, 
let’s set it aside and I’ll just start using a normal phone, is that what you 
want?”
Her Da held up his hands. “I surrender, Miss Pot. But do try to get a little 
more exercise, please? Fresh air? Sport? Games?”
“Getting my head trodden on in the hockey pitch, more like,” she said, 
darkly.
“Zackly!” he said, prodding her podge anew. “That’s the stuff! Getting my 
head trodden on was what made me the man I are today!”
Her Da could bluster all he liked about paying the bills, but she had 
pocket-money for the first time in her life: not book-tokens and fruit tokens and milk-tokens that could be exchanged for “healthy” snacks and 
literature. She had real money, cash money that she could spend outside 
of the 500 meter sugar-free zone that surrounded her school.
She wasn’t just kicking arse in the game, now—she was the richest kid 
she knew, and suddenly she was everybody’s best pal, with handsful of 
Curly Wurlies and Dairy Milks and Mars Bars that she could selectively 
distribute to her schoolmates.
#
“Go get a BFG,” Lucy said. “We’re going on a mission.”
Lucy’s voice in her ear was a constant companion in her life now. When 
she wasn’t on Fahrenheit Island, she and Lucy were running missions 
into the wee hours of the night. The Fahrenheit armorers, non-player characters, had learned to recognise her and they had the Clan’s BFGs 
oiled and ready for her when she showed up.
236 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
Today’s mission was close to home, which was good: the road-trips were 
getting tedious. Sometimes, non-player-characters or Game Masters 
would try to get them involved in an official in-game mission, impressed 
by their stats and weapons, and it sometimes broke her heart to pass 
them up, but cash always beat gold and experience beat experience 
points: Money talks and bullshit walks, as Lucy liked to say.
They caught the first round of sniper/lookouts before they had a chance 
to attack or send off a message. Anda used the scrying spell to spot them. 
Lucy had kept both BFGs armed and she loosed rounds at the hilltops 
flanking the roadway as soon as Anda gave her the signal, long before they 
got into bow range.
As they picked their way through the ruined chunks of the dead player character snipers, Anda still on the lookout, she broke the silence over 
their voicelink.
“Hey, Lucy?”
“Anda, if you’re not going to call me Sarge, at least don’t call me ‘Hey, 
Lucy!’ My dad loved that old TV show and he makes that joke every 
visitation day.”
“Sorry, Sarge. Sarge?”
“Yes, Anda?”
“I just can’t understand why anyone would pay us cash for these 
missions.”
“You complaining?”
“No, but—”
“Anyone asking you to cyber some old pervert?”
“No!”
“OK then. I don’t know either. But the money’s good. I don’t care. Hell, 
probably it’s two rich gamers who pay their butlers to craft for them all 
day. One’s fucking with the other one and paying us.”
“You really think that?”
Lucy sighed a put-upon, sophisticated, American sigh. “Look at it this 
way. Most of the world is living on like a dollar a day. I spend five dollars 
every day on a frappuccino. Some days, I get two! Dad sends mom three 
thousand a month in child-support—that’s a hundred bucks a day. So 
if a day’s money here is a hundred dollars, then to a African or whatever 
my frappuccino is worth like five hundred dollars. And I buy two or three 
every day.
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 237
“And we’re not rich! There’s craploads of rich people who wouldn’t think 
twice about spending five hundred bucks on a coffee—how much do you 
think a hotdog and a Coke go for on the space station? A thousand bucks!
“So that’s what I think is going on. There’s someone out there, some Saudi 
or Japanese guy or Russian mafia kid who’s so rich that this is just chump 
change for him, and he’s paying us to mess around with some other rich 
person. To them, we’re like the Africans making a dollar a day to craft—I 
mean, sew—t-shirts. What’s a couple hundred bucks to them? A cup of 
coffee.”
Anda thought about it. It made a kind of sense. She’d been on hols in 
Bratislava where they got a posh hotel room for ten quid—less than she 
was spending every day on sweeties and fizzy drinks.
“Three o’clock,” she said, and aimed the BFG again. More snipers pat patted in bits around the forest floor.
“Nice one, Anda.”
“Thanks, Sarge.”
#
They smashed half a dozen more sniper outposts and fought their way 
through a couple packs of suspiciously bad-ass brigands before coming 
upon the cottage.
“Bloody hell,” Anda breathed. The cottage was ringed with guards, forty 
or fifty of them, with bows and spells and spears, in entrenched positions.
“This is nuts,” Lucy agreed. “I’m calling them. This is nuts.”
There was a muting click as Lucy rang off and Anda used up a scrying 
scroll to examine the inventories of the guards around the corner. The 
more she looked, the more scared she got. They were loaded down 
with spells, a couple of them were guarding BFGs and what looked like 
an even bigger BFG, maybe the fabled BFG10K, something that was 
removed from the game economy not long after gameday one, as too 
disruptive to the balance of power. Supposedly, one or two existed, but 
that was just a rumor. Wasn’t it?
“OK,” Lucy said. “OK, this is how this goes. We’ve got to do this. I just 
called in three squads of Fahrenheit veterans and their noob prentices 
for backup.” Anda summed that up in her head to a hundred player 
characters and maybe three hundred nonplayer characters: familiars, 
servants, demons;
“That’s a lot of shares to split the pay into,” Anda said.
“Oh ye of little tits,” Lucy said. “I’ve negotiated a bonus for us if we make 
it—a million gold and three missions’ worth of cash. The Fahrenheits are 
238 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
taking payment in gold—they’ll be here in an hour.”
This wasn’t a mission anymore, Anda realized. It was war. Gamewar. 
Hundreds of players converging on this shard, squaring off against the 
ranked mercenaries guarding the huge cottage over the hill.
#
Lucy wasn’t the ranking Fahrenheit on the scene, but she was the 
designated general. One of the gamers up from Fahrenheit Island brought 
a team flag for her to carry, a long spear with the magical standard 
snapping proudly from it as the troops formed up behind her.
“On my signal,” Lucy said. The voice chat was like a wind-tunnel from all 
the unmuted breathing voices, hundreds of girls in hundreds of bedrooms 
like Anda’s, all over the world, some sitting down before breakfast, some 
just coming home from school, some roused from sleep by their ringing 
game-sponsored mobiles. “GO GO GO!”
They went, roaring, and Anda roared too, heedless of her parents 
downstairs in front of the blaring telly, heedless of her throat-lining, a 
Fahrenheit in berzerker rage, sword swinging. She made straight for the 
BFG10K—a siege engine that could level a town wall, and it would be 
hers, captured by her for the Fahrenheits if she could do it. She spelled 
the merc who was cranking it into insensibility, rolled and rolled again to 
dodge arrows and spells, healed herself when an arrow found her leg and 
sent her tumbling, springing to her feet before another arrow could strike 
home, watching her hit points and experience points move in opposite 
directions.
HERS! She vaulted the BFG10K and snicker-snacked her sword through 
two mercs’ heads. Two more appeared—they had the thing primed and 
aimed at the main body of Fahrenheit fighters, and they could turn the 
battle’s tide just by firing it—and she killed them, slamming her keypad, 
howling, barely conscious of the answering howls in her headset.
Now she had the BFG10K, though more mercs were closing on her. She 
disarmed it quickly and spelled at the nearest bunch of mercs, then had 
to take evasive action against the hail of incoming arrows and spells. It 
was all she could do to cast healing spells fast enough to avoid losing 
consciousness.
“LUCY!” she called into her headset. “LUCY, OVER BY THE BFG10K!”
Lucy snapped out orders and the opposition before Anda began to thin as 
Fahrenheits fell on them from behind. The flood was stemmed, and now 
the Fahrenheits’ greater numbers and discipline showed. In short order, 
every merc was butchered or run off.
Anda waited by the BFG10K while Lucy paid off the Fahrenheits and saw 
them on their way. “Now we take the cottage,” Lucy said.
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 239
“Right,” Anda said. She set her character off for the doorway. Lucy 
brushed past her.
“I’ll be glad when we’re done with this—that was bugfuck nutso.” She 
opened the door and her character disappeared in a fireball that erupted 
from directly overhead. A door-curse, a serious one, one that cooked her 
in her armor in seconds.
“SHIT!” Lucy said in her headset.
Anda giggled. “Teach you to go rushing into things,” she said. She used 
up a couple scrying scrolls making sure that there was nothing else in the 
cottage save for millions of shirts and thousands of unarmed noob avatars 
that she’d have to mow down like grass to finish out the mission.
She descended upon them like a reaper, swinging her sword heedlessly, 
taking five or six out with each swing. When she’d been a noob in the 
game, she’d had to endure endless fighting practice, “grappling” with piles 
of leaves and other nonlethal targets, just to get enough experience points 
to have a chance of hitting anything. This was every bit as dull.
Her wrists were getting tired, and her chest heaved and her hated podge 
wobbled as she worked the keypad.
> Wait, please, don’t—I’d like to speak with 
you
It was a noob avatar, just like the others, but not just like it after all, for it 
moved with purpose, backing away from her sword. And it spoke English.
> nothing personal
she typed
> just a job
> There are many here to kill—take me last at 
least. I need to talk to you.
> talk, then
she typed. Meeting players who moved well and spoke English was hardly 
unusual in gamespace, but here in the cleanup phase, it felt out of place. 
It felt wrong.
> My name is Raymond, and I live in Tijuana. I 
am a labour organizer in the factories here. 
What is your name?
> i don’t give out my name in-game
> What can I call you?
240 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
> kali
It was a name she liked to use in-game: Kali, Destroyer of Worlds, like the 
Hindu goddess.
> Are you in India?
> london
> You are Indian?
> naw im a whitey
She was halfway through the room, mowing down the noobs in twos and 
threes. She was hungry and bored and this Raymond was weirding her 
out.
> Do you know who these people are that you’re 
killing?
She didn’t answer, but she had an idea. She killed four more and shook 
out her wrists.
> They’re working for less than a dollar a day. 
The shirts they make are traded for gold and 
the gold is sold on eBay. Once their avatars 
have leveled up, they too are sold off on eBay. 
They’re mostly young girls supporting their 
families. They’re the lucky ones: the unlucky 
ones work as prostitutes.
Her wrists really ached. She slaughtered half a dozen more.
> The bosses used to use bots, but the game has 
countermeasures against them. Hiring children 
to click the mouse is cheaper than hiring 
programmers to circumvent the rules. I’ve been 
trying to unionize them because they’ve got a 
very high rate of injury. They have to play

She cut his head off. Her wrists hurt. She was hungry. She was alone there 
in the enormous woodland cottage, and she still had to haul the BFG10K 
back to Fahrenheit Island.
“Lucy?”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m almost back there, hang on. I respawned in the ass end of 
nowhere.”
“Lucy, do you know who’s in the cottage? Those noobs that we kill?”
“What? Hell no. Noobs. Someone’s butler. I dunno. Jesus, that spawn 
gate—”
“Girls. Little girls in Mexico. Getting paid a dollar a day to craft shirts. 
Except they don’t get their dollar when we kill them. They don’t get 
anything.”
“Oh, for chrissakes, is that what one of them told you? Do you believe 
everything someone tells you in-game? Christ. English girls are so naive.”
“You don’t think it’s true?”
“Naw, I don’t.”
“Why not?”
“I just don’t, OK? I’m almost there, keep your panties on.”
“I’ve got to go, Lucy,” she said. Her wrists hurt, and her podge overlapped 
the waistband of her trousers, making her feel a bit like she was drowning.
242 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
“What, now? Shit, just hang on.”
“My mom’s calling me to supper. You’re almost here, right?”
“Yeah, but—”
She reached down and shut off her PC.
#
Anda’s Da and Mum were watching the telly again with a bowl of crisps 
between them. She walked past them like she was dreaming and stepped 
out the door onto the terrace. It was nighttime, 11 o’clock, and the chavs 
in front of the council flats across the square were kicking a football 
around and swilling lager and making rude noises. They were skinny and 
rawboned, wearing shorts and string vests with strong, muscular limbs 
flashing in the streetlights.
“Anda?”
“Yes, Mum?”
“Are you all right?” Her mum’s fat fingers caressed the back of her neck.
“Yes, Mum. Just needed some air is all.”
“You’re very clammy,” her mum said. She licked a finger and scrubbed it 
across Anda’s neck. “Gosh, you’re dirty—how did you get to be such a 
mucky puppy?”
“Owww!” she said. Her mum was scrubbing so hard it felt like she’d take 
her skin off.
“No whingeing,” her mum said sternly. “Behind your ears, too! You 
are filthy.”
“Mum, owwww!”
Her mum dragged her up to the bathroom and went at her with a flannel 
and a bar of soap and hot water until she felt boiled and raw.
“What is this mess?” her mum said.
“Lilian, leave off,” her dad said, quietly. “Come out into the hall for a 
moment, please.”
The conversation was too quiet to hear and Anda didn’t want to, anyway: 
she was concentrating too hard on not crying—her ears hurt.
Her mum enfolded her shoulders in her soft hands again. “Oh, 
darling, I’m sorry. It’s a skin condition, your father tells me, Acanthosis 
Nigricans—he saw it in a TV special. We’ll see the doctor about it 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 243
tomorrow after school. Are you all right?”
“I’m fine,” she said, twisting to see if she could see the “dirt” on the 
back of her neck in the mirror. It was hard because it was an awkward 
placement—but also because she didn’t like to look at her face and her 
soft extra chin, and she kept catching sight of it.
She went back to her room to google Acanthosis 
Nigricans.
> A condition involving darkened, thickened 
skin. Found in the folds of skin at the base of 
the back of the neck, under the arms, inside 
the elbow and at the waistline. Often precedes 
a diagnosis of type-2 diabetes, especially 
in children. If found in children, immediate 
steps must be taken to prevent diabetes, 
including exercise and nutrition as a means of 
lowering insulin levels and increasing insulin sensitivity.
Obesity-related diabetes. They had lectures on this every term in health 
class—the fastest-growing ailment among British teens, accompanied by 
photos of orca-fat sacks of lard sat up in bed surrounded by an ocean of 
rubbery, flowing podge. Anda prodded her belly and watched it jiggle.
It jiggled. Her thighs jiggled. Her chins wobbled. Her arms sagged.
She grabbed a handful of her belly and squeezed it, pinched it hard as she 
could, until she had to let go or cry out. She’d left livid red fingerprints in 
the rolls of fat and she was crying now, from the pain and the shame and 
oh, God, she was a fat girl with diabetes—
#
“Jesus, Anda, where the hell have you been?”
“Sorry, Sarge,” she said. “My PC’s been broken—” Well, out of service, 
anyway. Under lock-and-key in her dad’s study. Almost a month now of 
medications and no telly and no gaming and double PE periods at school 
with the other whales. She was miserable all day, every day now, with 
nothing to look forward to except the trips after school to the newsagents 
at the 501-meter mark and the fistsful of sweeties and bottles of fizzy 
drink she ate in the park while she watched the chavs play footy.
“Well, you should have found a way to let me know. I was getting worried 
about you, girl.”
“Sorry, Sarge,” she said again. The PC Baang was filled with stinky spotty 
boys—literally stinky, it smelt like goats, like a train-station toilet—being 
loud and obnoxious. The dinky headphones provided were greasy as a 
slice of pizza, and the mouthpiece was sticky with excited boy-saliva from 
244 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
games gone past.
But it didn’t matter. Anda was back in the game, and just in time, too: her 
money was running short.
“Well, I’ve got a backlog of missions here. I tried going out with a couple 
other of the girls—” A pang of regret shot through Anda at the thought 
that her position might have been usurped while she was locked off the 
game “—but you’re too good to replace, OK? I’ve got four missions we 
can do today if you’re game.”
“Four missions! How on earth will we do four missions? That’ll take days!”
“We’ll take the BFG10K.” Anda could hear the savage grin in her voice.
#
The BFG10K simplified things quite a lot. Find the cottage, aim the 
BFG10K, fire it, whim-wham, no more cottage. They started with five 
bolts for it—one BFG10K bolt was made up of 20 regular BFG bolts, 
each costing a small fortune in gold—and used them all up on the first 
three targets. After returning it to the armory and grabbing a couple of 
BFGs (amazing how puny the BFG seemed after just a couple hours’ 
campaigning with a really big gun!) they set out for number four.
“I met a guy after the last campaign,” Anda said. “One of the noobs in the 
cottage. He said he was a union organizer.”
“Oh, you met Raymond, huh?”
“You knew about him?”
“I met him too. He’s been turning up everywhere. What a creep.”
“So you knew about the noobs in the cottages?”
“Um. Well, yeah, I figured it out mostly on my own and then Raymond 
told me a little more.”
“And you’re fine with depriving little kids of their wages?”
“Anda,” Lucy said, her voice brittle. “You like gaming, right, it’s important 
to you?”
“Yeah, ‘course it is.”
“How important? Is it something you do for fun, just a hobby you waste a 
little time on? Are you just into it casually, or are you committed to it?”
“I’m committed to it, Lucy, you know that.” God, without the game, 
what was there? PE class? Stupid Acanthosis Nigricans and, someday, 
insulin jabs every morning? “I love the game, Lucy. It’s where my friends 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 245
are.”
“I know that. That’s why you’re my right-hand woman, why I want you 
at my side when I go on a mission. We’re bad-ass, you and me, as bad-ass 
as they come, and we got that way through discipline and hard work and 
really caring about the game, right?”
“Yes, right, but—”
“You’ve met Liza the Organiza, right?”
“Yes, she came by my school.”
“Mine too. She asked me to look out for you because of what she saw in 
you that day.”
“Liza the Organiza goes to Ohio?”
“Idaho. Yes—all across the US. They put her on the tube and everything. 
She’s amazing, and she cares about the game, too—that’s what makes us 
all Fahrenheits: we’re committed to each other, to teamwork, and to fair 
play.”
Anda had heard these words—lifted from the Fahrenheit mission 
statement—many times, but now they made her swell a little with pride.
“So these people in Mexico or wherever, what are they doing? They’re 
earning their living by exploiting the game. You and me, we would never 
trade cash for gold, or buy a character or a weapon on eBay—it’s cheating. 
You get gold and weapons through hard work and hard play. But those 
Mexicans spend all day, every day, crafting stuff to turn into gold to sell 
off on the exchange. That’s where it comes from—that’s where the crappy 
players get their gold from! That’s how rich noobs can buy their way into 
the game that we had to play hard to get into.
“So we burn them out. If we keep burning the factories down, they’ll shut 
them down and those kids’ll find something else to do for a living and the 
game will be better. If no one does that, our work will just get cheaper and 
cheaper: the game will get less and less fun, too.
“These people don’t care about the game. To them, it’s just a place to suck 
a buck out of. They’re not players, they’re leeches, here to suck all the fun 
out.”
They had come upon the cottage now, the fourth one, having 
exterminated four different sniper-nests on the way.
“Are you in, Anda? Are you here to play, or are you so worried about these 
leeches on the other side of the world that you want out?”
“I’m in, Sarge,” Anda said. She armed the BFGs and pointed them at the 
cottage.
246 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
“Boo-yah!” Lucy said. Her character notched an arrow.
> Hello, Kali
“Oh, Christ, he’s back,” Lucy said. Raymond’s avatar had snuck up behind 
them.> Look at these
he said, and his character set something down on the ground and backed 
away. Anda edged up on them.
“Come on, it’s probably a booby-trap, we’ve got work to do,” Lucy said.
They were photo-objects. She picked them up and then examined them. 
The first showed ranked little girls, fifty or more, in clean and simple 
t-shirts, skinny as anything, sitting at generic white-box PCs, hands on 
the keyboards. They were hollow-eyed and grim, and none of them older 
than she.
The next showed a shantytown, shacks made of corrugated aluminum 
and trash, muddy trails between them, spraypainted graffiti, rude boys 
loitering, rubbish and carrier bags blowing.
The next showed the inside of a shanty, three little girls and a little boy 
sitting together on a battered sofa, their mother serving them something 
white and indistinct on plastic plates. Their smiles were heartbreaking and 
brave.
> That’s who you’re about to deprive of a day’s 
wages
“Oh, hell, no,” Lucy said. “Not again. I killed him last time and I said I’d 
do it again if he ever tried to show me photos. That’s it, he’s dead.” Her 
character turned towards him, putting away her bow and drawing a short 
sword. Raymond’s character backed away quickly.
“Lucy, don’t,” Anda said. She interposed her avatar between Lucy’s and 
Raymond. “Don’t do it. He deserves to have a say.” She thought of old 
American TV shows, the kinds you saw between the Bollywood movies on 
telly. “It’s a free country, right?”
“God damn it, Anda, what is wrong with you? Did you come here to play 
the game, or to screw around with this pervert dork?”
> what do you want from me raymond?
> Don’t kill them—let them have their wages. Go 
play somewhere else
> They’re leeches
Lucy typed,
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 247
> they’re wrecking the game economy and they’re 
providing a gold-for-cash supply that lets rich 
assholes buy their way in. They don’t care 
about the game and neither do you
> If they don’t play the game, they don’t eat. 
I think that means that they care about the 
game as much as you do. You’re being paid cash 
to kill them, yes? So you need to play for your 
money, too. I think that makes you and them the 
same, a little the same.
> go screw yourself
Lucy typed. Anda edged her character away from Lucy’s. Raymond’s 
character was so far away now that his texting came out in tiny type, 
almost too small to read. Lucy drew her bow again and nocked an arrow.
“Lucy, DON’T!” Anda cried. Her hands moved of their own volition and 
her character followed, clobbering Lucy barehanded so that her avatar 
reeled and dropped its bow.
“You BITCH!” Lucy said. She drew her sword.
“I’m sorry, Lucy,” Anda said, stepping back out of range. “But I don’t 
want you to hurt him. I want to hear him out.”
Lucy’s avatar came on fast, and there was a click as the voicelink dropped. 
Anda typed onehanded while she drew her own sword.
> dont lucy come on talk2me
Lucy slashed at her twice and she needed both hands to defend herself 
or she would have been beheaded. Anda blew out through her nose 
and counterattacked, fingers pounding the keyboard. Lucy had more 
experience points than she did, but she was a better player, and she knew 
it. She hacked away at Lucy driving her back and back, back down the 
road they’d marched together.
Abruptly, Lucy broke and ran, and Anda thought she was going away and 
decided to let her go, no harm no foul, but then she saw that Lucy wasn’t 
running away, she was running towards the BFGs, armed and primed.
“Bloody hell,” she breathed, as a BFG swung around to point at her. Her 
fingers flew. She cast the fireball at Lucy in the same instant that she cast 
her shield spell. Lucy loosed the bolt at her a moment before the fireball 
engulfed her, cooking her down to ash, and the bolt collided with the 
shield and drove Anda back, high into the air, and the shield spell wore 
off before she hit ground, costing her half her health and inventory, which 
scattered around her. She tested her voicelink.
“Lucy?”
248 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
There was no reply.
> I’m very sorry you and your friend quarreled.
She felt numb and unreal. There were rules for Fahrenheits, lots of rules, 
and the penalties for breaking them varied, but the penalty for attacking a 
fellow Fahrenheit was—she couldn’t think the word, she closed her eyes, 
but there it was in big glowing letters: EXPULSION.
But Lucy had started it, right? It wasn’t her fault.
But who would believe her?
She opened her eyes. Her vision swam through incipient tears. Her heart 
was thudding in her ears.
> The enemy isn’t your fellow player. It’s not 
the players guarding the fabrica, it’s not the 
girls working there. The people who are working 
to destroy the game are the people who pay 
you and the people who pay the girls in the 
fabrica, who are the same people. You’re being 
paid by rival factory owners, you know that? 
THEY are the ones who care nothing for the 
game. My girls care about the game. You care 
about the game. Your common enemy is the people 
who want to destroy the game and who destroy 
the lives of these girls.
“Whassamatter, you fat little cow? Is your game making you cwy?” She 
jerked as if slapped. The chav who was speaking to her hadn’t been in the 
Baang when she arrived, and he had mean, close-set eyes and a football 
jersey and though he wasn’t any older than she, he looked mean, and 
angry, and his smile was sadistic and crazy.
“Piss off,” she said, mustering her braveness.
“You wobbling tub of guts, don’t you DARE speak to me that way,” he 
said, shouting right in her ear. The Baang fell silent and everyone looked 
at her. The Pakistani who ran the Baang was on his phone, no doubt 
calling the coppers, and that meant that her parents would discover where 
she’d been and then—
“I’m talking to you, girl,” he said. “You disgusting lump of suet—Christ, 
it makes me wanta puke to look at you. You ever had a boyfriend? How’d 
he shag you—did he roll yer in flour and look for the wet spot?”
She reeled back, then stood. She drew her arm back and slapped him, as 
hard as she could. The boys in the Baang laughed and went whoooooo! 
He purpled and balled his fists and she backed away from him. The 
imprint of her fingers stood out on his cheek.
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 249
He bridged the distance between them with a quick step and punched her, 
in the belly, and the air whooshed out of her and she fell into another 
player, who pushed her away, so she ended up slumped against the wall, 
crying.
The mean boy was there, right in front of her, and she could smell the 
chili crisps on his breath. “You disgusting whore—” he began and she 
kneed him square in the nadgers, hard as she could, and he screamed like 
a little girl and fell backwards. She picked up her schoolbag and ran for 
the door, her chest heaving, her face streaked with tears.
#
“Anda, dear, there’s a phone call for you.”
Her eyes stung. She’d been lying in her darkened bedroom for hours now, 
snuffling and trying not to cry, trying not to look at the empty desk where 
her PC used to live.
Her da’s voice was soft and caring, but after the silence of her room, it 
sounded like a rusting hinge.
“Anda?”
She opened her eyes. He was holding a cordless phone, sillhouetted 
against the open doorway.
“Who is it?”
“Someone from your game, I think,” he said. He handed her the phone.
“Hullo?”
“Hullo chicken.” It had been a year since she’d heard that voice, but she 
recognised it instantly.
“Liza?”
“Yes.”
Anda’s skin seemed to shrink over her bones. This was it: expelled. Her 
heart felt like it was beating once per second, time slowed to a crawl.
“Hullo, Liza.”
“Can you tell me what happened today?”
She did, stumbling over the details, back-tracking and stuttering. She 
couldn’t remember, exactly—did Lucy move on Raymond and Anda 
asked her to stop and then Lucy attacked her? Had Anda attacked Lucy 
first? It was all a jumble. She should have saved a screenmovie and taken it 
with her, but she couldn’t have taken anything with her, she’d run out—
250 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
“I see. Well it sounds like you’ve gotten yourself into quite a pile of poo, 
haven’t you, my girl?”
“I guess so,” Anda said. Then, because she knew that she was as good as 
expelled, she said, “I don’t think it’s right to kill them, those girls. All 
right?”
“Ah,” Liza said. “Well, funny you should mention that. I happen to agree. 
Those girls need our help more than any of the girls anywhere in the 
game. The Fahrenheits’ strength is that we are cooperative—it’s another 
way that we’re better than the boys. We care. I’m proud that you took a 
stand when you did—glad I found out about this business.”
“You’re not going to expel me?”
“No, chicken, I’m not going to expel you. I think you did the right 
thing—”
That meant that Lucy would be expelled. Fahrenheit had killed 
Fahrenheit—something had to be done. The rules had to be enforced. 
Anda swallowed hard.
“If you expel Lucy, I’ll quit,” she said, quickly, before she lost her nerve.
Liza laughed. “Oh, chicken, you’re a brave thing, aren’t you? No one’s 
being expelled, fear not. But I wanta talk to this Raymond of yours.”
#
Anda came home from remedial hockey sweaty and exhausted, but not 
as exhausted as the last time, nor the time before that. She could run the 
whole length of the pitch twice now without collapsing—when she’d 
started out, she could barely make it halfway without having to stop and 
hold her side, kneading her loathsome podge to make it stop aching. Now 
there was noticeably less podge, and she found that with the ability to run 
the pitch came the freedom to actually pay attention to the game, to aim 
her shots, to build up a degree of accuracy that was nearly as satisfying as 
being really good in-game.
Her dad knocked at the door of her bedroom after she’d showered and 
changed. “How’s my girl?”
“Revising,” she said, and hefted her maths book at him.
“Did you have a fun afternoon on the pitch?”
“You mean ‘did my head get trod on’?”
“Did it?”
“Yes,” she said. “But I did more treading than getting trodden on.” The 
other girls were really fat, and they didn’t have a lot of team skills. Anda 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 251
had been to war: she knew how to depend on someone and how to be 
depended upon.
“That’s my girl.” He pretended to inspect the paint-work around the light 
switch. “Been on the scales this week?”
She had, of course: the school nutritionist saw to that, a morning 
humiliation undertaken in full sight of all the other fatties.
“Yes, Dad.”
“And—?”
“I’ve lost a stone,” she said. A little more than a stone, actually. She had 
been able to fit into last year’s jeans the other day.
She hadn’t been the sweets-shop in a month. When she thought about 
sweets, it made her think of the little girls in the sweatshop. Sweatshop, 
sweetshop. The sweets shop man sold his wares close to the school because 
little girls who didn’t know better would be tempted by them. No one 
forced them, but they were kidsand grownups were supposed to look out 
for kids.
Her da beamed at her. “I’ve lost three pounds myself,” he said, holding his 
tum. “I’ve been trying to follow your diet, you know.”
“I know, Da,” she said. It embarrassed her to discuss it with him.
The kids in the sweatshops were being exploited by grownups, too. It was 
why their situation was so impossible: the adults who were supposed to be 
taking care of them were exploiting them.
“Well, I just wanted to say that I’m proud of you. We both are, your Mum 
and me. And I wanted to let you know that I’ll be moving your PC back 
into your room tomorrow. You’ve earned it.”
Anda blushed pink. She hadn’t really expected this. Her fingers twitched 
over a phantom game-controller.
“Oh, Da,” she said. He held up his hand.
“It’s all right, girl. We’re just proud of you.”
#
She didn’t touch the PC the first day, nor the second. The kids in the 
game—she didn’t know what to do about them. On the third day, after 
hockey, she showered and changed and sat down and slipped the headset 
on.
“Hello, Anda.”
252 Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction)
“Hi, Sarge.”
Lucy had known the minute she entered the game, which meant that she 
was still on Lucy’s buddy-list. Well, that was a hopeful sign.
“You don’t have to call me that. We’re the same rank now, after all.”
Anda pulled down a menu and confirmed it: she’d been promoted to 
Sergeant during her absence. She smiled.
“Gosh,” she said.
“Yes, well, you earned it,” Lucy said. “I’ve been talking to Raymond a lot 
about the working conditions in the factory, and, well—” She broke off. 
“I’m sorry, Anda.”
“Me too, Lucy.”
“You don’t have anything to be sorry about,” she said.
They went adventuring, running some of the game’s standard missions 
together. It was fun, but after the kind of campaigning they’d done 
before, it was also kind of pale and flat.
“It’s horrible, I know,” Anda said. “But I miss it.”
“Oh thank God,” Lucy said. “I thought I was the only one. It was fun, 
wasn’t it? Big fights, big stakes.”
“Well, poo,” Anda said. “I don’t wanna be bored for the rest of my life. 
What’re we gonna do?”
“I was hoping you knew.”
She thought about it. The part she’d loved had been going up against 
grownups who were not playing the game, but gaming it, breaking it for 
money. They’d been worthy adversaries, and there was no guilt in beating 
them, either.
“We’ll ask Raymond how we can help,” she said.
#
“I want them to walk out—to go on strike,” he said. “It’s the only way 
to get results: band together and withdraw your labour.” Raymond’s 
voice had a thick Mexican accent that took some getting used to, but his 
English was very good—better, in fact, than Lucy’s.
“Walk out in-game?” Lucy said.
“No,” Raymond said. “That wouldn’t be very effective. I want them to 
walk out in Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana. I’ll call the press in, we’ll make a 
Reality Hackers : Extended : Anda’s game (Short fiction) 253
big deal out of it. We can win—I know we can.”
“So what’s the problem?” Anda said.
“The same problem as always. Getting them organized. I thought that the 
game would make it easier: we’ve been trying to get these girls organized 
for years: in the sewing shops, and the toy factories, but they lock the 
doors and keep us out and the girls go home and their parents won’t let us 
talk to them. But in the game, I thought I’d be able to reach them—”
“But the bosses keep you away?”
“I keep getting killed. I’ve been practicing my swordfighting, but it’s so 
hard—”
“This will be fun,” Anda said. “Let’s go.”
“Where?” Lucy said.
“To an in-game factory. We’re your new bodyguards.” The bosses hired 
some pretty mean mercs, Anda knew. She’d been one. They’d be fun to 
wipe out.
Raymond’s character spun around on the screen, then planted a kiss on 
Anda’s cheek. Anda made her character give him a playful shove that sent 
him sprawling.
“Hey, Lucy, go get us a couple BFGs, OK?”

End Note: some may wonder why this was formatted similar to a unit 
read-out for an RTS (or just wonder why it looks weird, in which case, 
it’s because it was formatted as the aforementioned RTS unit read-out). 
The reasoning is simple: I am eccentric, and I am bored. I guess the entire 
thing could have been summed up in that line alone, but where’s the fun 
in that?
Annnnnnd now to fulfill the criteria of the actual assignment:
My name is Evan Barnett, and I was born and raised in Austin, TX. I’m 
20 years old, a sophomore, and a computer science major. I am also 
thinking of doing a double major/minor with communications.
My main interest is in gaming. Ever since I was a child (to be exact, 6 
years old) I’ve been playing games, and it’s been my dream to develop 
them for a long time (God that sounds cheesy). Also, as a side note, 
gaming refers not to just video games, but board games as well (however, I 
spend most of my time on video games).
I have a fair amount of experience with general usage of computers, and 
programming. In middle school I took two multimedia classes that went 
over a diverse range of topics (and was actually fairly in-depth. Still some 
of my favorite classes to this day.), and in high school I took two years of 
Java (and hated the language. Playing games was AWESOME though). I 
have continued learning programming languages and skills in college.
Aside from computer science, I am also very interested in various 
communications topics, such as public relations, media trends/analysis, 
and how to effectively communicate an idea to other people in a business 
setting.
In conclusion, some miscellaneous stuff: I enjoy Chuck Klosterman 
books, Gerald Way when he is writing comics, Doctor Who, action 
figures, nerf gun fights, and raspberries. Also: I have never broken a bone 
in my body. I have worked at a library for almost 3 years, AND I was a 
webmaster for PCL at UT.
4.1 A Day in the Life. Still from original ma chinima video created by Evan Barnett for the 
Lennox seminar. Evan explains: “A Day in the Life 
is a short machinima (the use of real-time graph ics rendering engines, mostly three-dimensional 
(3-D), to generate computer animation, Wikipedia) 
that looks into what could be the near future 
and tells the story of a government agent trying 
to locate someone who has gone missing. Covering 
concepts from the panopticon and the participatory 
panopticon, as well as how machines and AI will 
affect our lives, A Day in the Life is meant to 
be pseudo-realistic, and relevant to the present 
day.” 
“First, what is the panopticon? In short, it’s 
a way a source of authority uses our paranoia 
against us. The basic concept is that because the 
authority could be keeping us under surveillance 
at any time, we won’t misbehave because we don’t 
want to be unlucky enough to get caught; a fairly 
effective theory, in my eyes. However, what’s more 
powerful is the participatory panopticon. The 
idea behind the participatory panopticon is that 
it takes away the source of authority, and puts 
the power of surveillance in the hands, or eyes, 
of the population. Every person could be watching 
you, and therefore you are even less likely to 
misbehave. With technologies such as cell phone 
cameras, YouTube, and public web cams, it’s also 
easy to be recorded, and not just seen.” 
“In my machinima, the view of the ‘target’ is 
constantly changing. The first camera is a security 
camera, which most people are okay with being seen 
on. It’s there to protect you. However, as the 
narrative progresses, the source of the camera 
becomes more and more personal. Be it a cell phone 
camera, a TV camera, or the camera in the back of 
your car, these are all devices which we don’t re ally see being used to keep tabs on the populous. 
What I wish to get across is that the technologies 
we all use today that seem completely irrelevant 
to anything but entertainment, can be easily ap plied to surveillance.”
“That brings me to technology, and its rapid 
advancement. As this is set in the near future, 
we’re still on Earth, everything is mostly normal 
(from what is shown), and the robots haven’t taken 
over. However, there have been massive strides in 
Artificial Intelligence from now until whenever the 
events in the machinima take place. These strides 
in AI are part of what I think is necessary to 
apply those entertainment technologies, such as 
YouTube and cell phone cameras, to surveillance. 
What we lack right now is an entity that can pull 
all the necessary data (YouTube videos, cell phone 
records (video, text, or call), security footage, 
etc.) into one place and put it together in a 
relevant sequence of events. However, once we can 
even get an entity that can put together public/
security footage into a timeline (so, pulling 
things such as YouTube videos, security footage, 
and TV footage together) and advance our facial 
recognition technology, then we’re already at the 
threshold. All the entity needs is clearance to 
the private data.”
“And who says this is bad? In my machinima, the 
technology is being used to find someone who was 
attacked. However, the technology could eas ily spawn something similar to U.S.Ident, a Big 
Brother, government surveillance branch in South land Tales.

ANDREW COE
Hey everyone, my name is Andrew Coe (as you can see). I am from 
Houston, Texas, not born there but spent most of my life there. For all 
you Houston kids out there, I went to St. Thomas Episcopal School in 
Meyerland near Bellaire. What else is there to know about me fact-wise? 
Let’s see, I'm about to be 21 at the end of January and I'm a Junior. That 
is about all I can think of at the moment. 
Now for other useless facts about me....I love sports. If there is one thing 
I would want to do in life it would be work for a sports team. I grew up 
playing soccer and I played for 8 years but no longer play on a team due 
to two blown knees, but I still play intramural sports. Soccer is, as you 
can probably tell, my favorite sport. But I also love football (college and 
pro) and baseball. I'm slowly starting to get into basketball. I spend much 
of my spare time reading about sports and the goings-on in the world of 
sports through sports blogs and professional journalism sources. 
Not to say that blogs aren't professional; it's just a way of distinguishing 
between reading an article on ESPN or Yahoo! Sports and Kissing Suzy 
Kolber (a fairly popular sports blog). So if anyone ever wants to talk 
sports I am always game. I'll talk about any team but my favorites are the 
Dallas Cowboys, Texas Longhorns, Houston Astros, Houston Rockets, 
Houston Texans, and the Chelsea Blues. Just as a disclaimer though, I 
despise the Yankees, Patriots, and FC Barcelona. I apologize if you are a 
fan of these teams.
I love watching movies too. My favorite movie of all time is The Godfather 
Part I. Part II is good too but Part III is garbage. Favorite director has to 
be Ridley Scott. I love the attention to detail he has to his movies and 
the epic feel of almost all of them. Blade Runner and Gladiator are my 
two favorite by him. As far as my single favorite scene of all time, it is 
a tie between the John Travolta/Sam Jackson "Say what again" scene in 
Pulp Fiction and the scene in The Godfather Part I where Michael kills 
Sollozzo. The Pulp Fiction scene because it is just hilarious and I like it 
and the Godfather scene because, in my opinion, it is the most crucial 
scene in the entire movie and one of the greatest scenes in all of film as 
far as turning points and such go. I hope that makes sense. If you've seen 
the whole movie you'll know what I'm talking about, if not then I highly 
recommend watching the movie.

PATRICK CRIM
I am currently twenty and attend Trinity University in San Antonio, 
Texas. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, where my father, Randy, was going 
through his residency as a surgeon. When I was three, my family moved 
back to Dallas where my mother, Ellen, and her parents are from and 
where my dad began his practice. I have three other siblings: Emily, who 
is twenty two and a senior at the University of Texas in Austin, Andrew, 
who is fifteen and a freshman at Jesuit College Preparatory School where I 
went to high school, and Charlotte, who is thirteen and in seventh grade 
at St. Monica Catholic School, where I also went to middle school.
I have always loved sports. My first sports team was when I was three 
and played soccer for the Bearcats. I would then go on to play baseball, 
basketball, track, football, golf, and wrestling, to name a few. I have gone 
skiing every year with my family since I was four, and I consider myself to 
be very good at it. I currently play football for Trinity University, where I 
am one of the punters. I have played the piano since I was four, and I love 
all kinds of music.
I consider myself a very social person. I like having lots of friends in all 
different friend groups. I try not to judge people based on their initial 
appearance but I must admit I have been guilty of doing this before. My 
friends would tell you I'm trustworthy and a good listener, and I try to 
always be helpful and thoughtful of my roommate and of others. 
Currently I am on my way to be a Communication Major with a Minor 
in Spanish. I have taken Spanish ever since grade school and I hope to 
travel abroad to Spain in order to continue my studies. I have always 
thought it would be cool to be a sports anchor or something involving 
speaking such as being the spokesperson for a large company or being the 
P.R. man. Right now, however, I want to attend law school either at the 
University of Texas in Austin or SMU in Dallas. My mom is from a family 
of seven children and all of them are lawyers except for her. They are all 
part of a family law firm known as The Hartnett Law Firm. I hope to one 
day join them and continue this tradition

My name is Kendra Doshier and I'm a sophomore Communication 
Major here at Trinity. I'm probably going to fall into an English 
minor because I'm obsessed with taking English classes at Trinity, 
and the department is pretty much second home - same goes for the 
Communication Department. I'm a writer and a filmmaker when it 
really comes down to it, so my life pretty much revolves around those two 
activities. I'm working on two films at the moment; one is in the making, 
while the other is in post-production. I'm versed in Final Cut and Adobe 
Premiere, and love being behind the camera. Film school may be in the 
future, but I know my career will somehow involve creative writing/
directing. I hate staying in one place, so hopefully I'll move around a lot. 
I went abroad for a year when I was 15/16 to Italy, and I'm pretty good 
with foreign languages - so that's definitely something important me. 
Networking, traveling, exploring, growing... it's all wonderful and totally 
necessary.
I'm from Anchorage, Alaska and I'm not best friends with Sarah Palin. I 
do love snow and cold weather, so you can imagine I'm not the happiest 
of people when San Antonio goes through its obscenely hot months. 
Which is kind of all the time. I listen to strange types of music and 
will usually stand fiercely loyal to 'bad', misunderstood movies that 
don't make sense. I have a lot of experience with computers and video 
editing software, though I wouldn't exactly consider myself a techie. 
I'm interested in learning more about biohackers, because I've been so 
unfamiliar with the term and the idea is completely jarring to me. 
I'm sure that I will gain a lot from this new Lennox Seminar, and I'm 
excited to learn more! I'm a little worried about the computer game 
experimenting that will happen in this class, but I'm willing to learn 
anything! As for Southland Tales, I'm interested to see why this movie got 
such bad reviews.
KENDRA DOSHIER
I'm Chris D, a computer science major / senior on his last semester of 
college. I enjoy sci-fi, Internet culture, gaming, and watching a good 
movie (or a terrible movie. who cares). I'm really looking forward to this 
class because the topic ideas presented sounded really interesting to me.

ENDER ERGUN
Well, where to begin? Hopefully, some of you might know me by now, if 
not I guess this a chance to do so. I'm Ender. I'm Turkish (an excuse that 
I use to exemplify completely unrelated things). I am a junior this year. 
Now that the basic facts are aside, let's get down to the fine detail. I think 
a fine example of something that truly describes me is my astrological 
sign, which ironically is something I don't believe in. I am a Taurus, 
which describes most of my habits of being protective, patient, so on and 
so forth. I am a boxer, although I hate watching it. I guess that's why I 
hardly become aggravated because I take it out on some stranger in the 
ring. I was once a great fan of Legos, although in recent years my mild 
OCD (self-diagnosed) has made me into somewhat of a perfectionist 
when it comes to making things, which makes playing with Legos more of 
a chore than anything else. I think the best way to know me is just to ask; 
I like conversation more than typing. 
Regarding this year, I think things are going to be great. Awesome classes. 
Job that pays well. Recently started writing for the Trinitonian, although 
I don't like the name of my column, "Ender's Games," because it really 
does not help the fact that when I first meet people they usually respond 
with, "Ender? Like the book Ender's Game? Awesome!" 
Yes. Great book. Same name. Stop. I've been hearing that same line for 
like five years now. Back to why this year is going to be great. Single, 
finally. "But Ender, your ex might not appreciate the hinted sign of relief 
that you're no longer in a relationship with her!" Good. I'm actually 
not that bitter, if so at all. Just don't have to go through the daily grind 
of being in a relationship, it's very, pleasant. Well, I think I've ranted 
enough. But like I mentioned before, I enjoy conversation more than I 
do typing, so feel free to come up and ask something (non-creepy way is 
preferred).

ASHLEY FUNKHOUSER
I'm Ashley Funkhouser and I am a sophomore communication major 
from Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
After graduation, I hope to go to law school, and will probably return to 
New Mexico which I've realized is actually a really great place, now that 
I've been away from it for a little bit. Now, every time I go home I feel 
like a tourist, absolutely awestruck by how amazingly clear the sky is, how 
cool the city looks at night, and yes, how amazing green chile tastes on 
pizza (and pretty much everything else).
Here at Trinity, I'm currently a sophomore, the Sports Editor for 
the Trinitonian, the athletics chair for my sorority, Alpha Chi Lambda, 
and a member of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars and Alpha 
Lambda Delta. 
When I'm not busy with school, the newspaper or whatever else, I love 
to read and write, spend lots of time outside, and watch way too much 
TV. In fact, my TV addiction has gotten so bad that my parents gave me 
a DVD recorder for Christmas so that I can tape any shows that I miss 
because I'm too busy watching a show on another channel. It’s Heaven.

Hello, my name is Cole Gray and welcome to my blog The Parapatterner. 
In case you're wondering what a parapatterner is I suggest you read the 
short story entitled "The Worm that Flies" by Brian W. Aldiss, one of 
my favorite pieces of science fiction. Pretentious literary references aside 
though, I've never really been that into keeping a blog, visiting Facebook, 
'tweeting' or even texting so I'm still a bit of a novice when it comes to 
social technologies but I'll try my best to accommodate any person so 
kind enough to read my electronic monologues. 
So let's begin with some basic biographical facts.
I was born in Austin, Texas on June 26, 1989 and I'm currently 20 years 
old. I go to Trinity University in San Antonio as a sophomore looking 
into a major in Communication and a minor in Environmental Studies 
although I'm still not quite sure that this will be my final decision. I have 
an identical twin brother named Travis who also goes to Trinity and plans 
to major in History.
I have myriad interests but my main hobbies include reading, writing 
poetry, drawing, running, weight lifting and video games.
My favorite books are classic literature, authors like Dostoevsky, Kafka, 
Tolstoy, Hemmingway, Nietzsche and J.D. Salinger. I also like to read 
Shakespeare as well as Greek or Roman tragedies.
I tend to write a lot of poetry and have even gotten a few of poems 
published but I also like to read and memorize poetry. My favorite 
poets are T.S. Eliot, William Blake, Galway Kinnell and Samuel Taylor 
Coleridge.
I do like to draw and although I've never taken an actual drawing class I 
believe that I am pretty decent at it. My style is an attempt to combine 
photorealistic drawing with surreal landscapes or characters.
For my exercise I usually sprint about eight miles and lift some free 
weights coupled with a lot of sit-ups and pushups every other day.
As for my religious views I consider myself an existential atheist.
I hope that covers just about everything, thanks for reading.
COLE GRAY

My name is Sarah and I am a sophomore at Trinity University and I am 
20 years old. My major is undeclared but I want to be a communication 
major. With all the classes I will have taken in art and drama by the end of 
my time here maybe I will be able to minor in one or both of those. Even 
though I am taking art and drama classes, I am not a very good actor 
or artist, but I enjoy the classes. Right now, besides this class, I am also 
taking a photography class, introduction to stage lighting, introduction to 
dramatic literature, and rollerblading. Here at Trinity I am also involved 
in the horseback riding team. I show in the open division which is the 
highest division. We do show jumping. 
I was born in San Francisco in 1989 and lived there for the first three 
years of my life with my three sisters and parents. At the age of three my 
family moved to Hong Kong and my youngest sister was born. My father 
needed to move there for his job. I went to preschool, kindergarten, and 
half of first grade there. The school I went to was called Kellet School and 
it was British. I developed a British accent while living in Hong Kong but 
lost it when I moved back to the U.S. 
My family moved back to San Francisco when I was 6 years old. I went 
to school in San Francisco and Marin for elementary school. For High 
School I first went to Westover in Connecticut and then Foxcroft in 
Virginia. Both were all-girls boarding schools. I switched half way through 
my sophomore year. Since switching I have avoided snow except during 
the holidays. After high school I came to Trinity and am very happy with 
my choice for college. 
Something I love to do outside of school is horseback riding. I have been 
riding for 7 or 8 years now. I have had many horses that I share with my 
sisters. Three of my four sisters and my mother also ride horses. 
Burberry is my only horse right now. He is not very big but can jump 
pretty high. The kind of riding I do on Burberry is called hunters. It is 
based on foxhunting. A competitor must follow a posted course over 
about 8 jumps. Hunters started in order for a judge to decide how safe the 
competitor would be if they were out foxhunting with the solid jumps. 
The jumps are collapsible so it is not as dangerous. However, you can still 
be injured. I cut my face open, got a minor concussion, and fractured one 
of my fingers all in one fall. I am not entirely sure what I want to do in 
my future. All I know right now is that I would like to finish college and 
be able to horseback ride for as long as I can. I plan on being one of those 
crazy horse ladies who isn't very good at riding and everyone thinks is 
certifiable. It just seems like a lot of fun. I don't want to be the kind that 
thinks they can understand their horse though, that's a little crazy for me. 
Also, I'm almost certain that I will have severe memory loss when I'm 
older because I am already starting to have memory problems and there 
is a history of it in my family. I do know that once I am done with all 
my schooling I would like to live in California. I think it is much prettier 
than Texas. Texas is very fun, but I love my home state.

JOHN KEY
I guess I would have to classify myself as a gamer (I have spent too many 
hours of my life playing videogames not to) but I am not fully devoted 
to one game or another. I have been through large phases of Call of Duty, 
World of Warcraft, Team Fortress, and Civilization as well as a few others. 
Currently the main game I am playing however is unfortunately World of 
Warcraft.
Outside of the gaming world I really don’t have a specialty per se. I am 
somewhat involved in a little bit of everything and like with games I 
go through phases. I work for the admissions office on campus, I sing 
in two of the choirs, etc. As for field of study, I am a double major in 
both art and communications with a minor in business. Hopefully this 
field of study will lead me into advertising and marketing which I find 
fascinating.
I tend to be a bit scatter brained at times and don’t really like to focus on 
one thing in particular unless it is really fascinating. So my mind is pretty 
much on whatever it is I’m thinking about at the time. Maybe it is split 
between writing a few paragraphs and watching Glee at the same time, 
and not to mention checking my e-mail in between things. That is why 
they created tabbed browsing right?

Hey guys! My name is Chris Kradle and I am a sophomore from Eagan, 
MN. Hopefully, I will be double majoring in Political Science and 
Communication. My dream job is to be a lobbyist for the MN teachers 
association. I have only taken two communication classes so far: Media 
Interpretation and Criticism and Mass Media. So far, those classes have 
kept my attention with interesting subject matter. 
My friends back home are much bigger computer nerds than I am, so 
they are surprised that I am taking this class, and think I will do horribly 
in this class. I want to prove them wrong and get a decent grade. I never 
have had any experience with the topic of hackers, but I was told that this 
class would not only interest me, but also teach me. 
I sit in the back row not because I hate classes, but because it is a ritual I 
have in the Richardson building. I am already interested in the lecturers; 
hopefully they don't let me down. Looking forward to this semester and 
learning about reality hackers!
CHRIS KRADLE
Well, if you're following this blog, you probably have too much time on 
the Internet.
Be that as it may, I'm going to start posting more stuff on here, not so 
much as an expression of free will, but as an expression of my desire to 
satisfy minimum requirements and graduate with a B.A. in Credible 
Sounding Prestige from my institute of higher learning.
So, basics...
I don't take anything very seriously,
I'm about to graduate and have only vague ideas about where I'm going 
next, 
I like long walks on the beach, romantic candlelit dinners, and am saving 
money so I can buy my future wife a lot of shiny trinkets.
I used to have a really high IQ, and then I started drinking Wild Turkey 
101 and Red Bull as a breakfast meal replacement.
I'd rather get one of those giant inflatable rafts and float around a 
swimming pool than program anything in Java or C++, which makes my 
second major in Computer Science seem kind of worthless.
That's all I care to think of now, so thanks and have a nice day.

SHEPHERD MCALLISTER
First and foremost, I really like to write...just not about myself. I'll start 
with the basics. I grew up in Lexington, VA. I've included a Google 
Maps satellite picture of that town below. Exciting, right? Having grown 
up in such a tiny place, I wanted to be sure to go to school in a city with 
places open after 8, and preferably a professional sports team. So now I 
find myself as a sophomore at Trinity University, and couldn't be happier 
about it.
I'm double majoring in communication and political science, and took 
the Hackers class with Dr. Delwiche last semester. Feel free to check out 
my previous entries in this blog for thoughts on my experiences in this 
class. I was lucky enough to come into Trinity with a lot of AP credits to 
put towards my common curriculum, so most of my classes to this point 
have been in one of my two majors. Currently I'm working on some 
research with Dr. Nishikawa in the political science department regarding 
a link between online political participation and real world political 
action. It is a nice melding of my two academic interests.
In addition to being a full time student here at Trinity, I also have a part 
time job with the San Antonio Spurs in the new media department. I 
perform various tasks to assist in keeping Spurs.com, sasilverstars.com, 
and sarampage.com up and running. My tasks include shooting and 
editing videos, taking and posting photos, creating some special content, 
and assisting with game night responsibilities. It's time consuming, 
occasionally stressful, and certainly makes my life more complicated, but I 
wouldn't trade the experience for anything.
In my free time I enjoy playing sports, especially basketball, tennis, 
racquetball, and even a little pick-up football. I'm also a bit of a 
web junkie. Not a day goes by that I don't check my Google Reader 
(populated with nerdy feeds like Gizmodo and Lifehacker). I'm slightly 
obsessed with all things Apple, and I'm a bit embarrassed to say that 
I look forward to all of their major product announcements. I love 
shooting and editing videos; I'm getting started with photography. 
Hopefully my abilities will come in handy in the development of our 
transmedia project this semester.

MARK MCCULLOUGH
My name is Mark and I am a Junior History major and Communication 
minor studying in the hills of San Antonio. My classes this semester are 
proving to be a bit more of a challenge compared with past semesters. 
I am finally getting into more advanced methods of studying history 
and the materials are become more complex! I am trying to specialize 
in European history because I find the links to families and dynasties 
interesting and unique. For Communication I am focusing my attention 
on the effectiveness of games in the classroom. I am planning on 
attending the Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) program for my fifth 
year, so hopefully I can use my knowledge from Communication to create 
new ways of teaching. Other than that, each day seems like it's SSDD... 
which can make things monotonous from time-to-time but overall liberal 
arts style here at Trinity has helped me develop and continue to learn!
I was born in Arizona and can't wait to get back. I enjoy golfing and 
flying in and around Arizona and Scottsdale. It's a fun place to live 
and the mountains are amazing. I've been told from time to time that 
I act like a 40 year old... which is probably true, but I don’t know if it's 
necessarily a bad thing. :) I obtained my pilot's license a few years back 
and love the feeling of freedom while in the air; it's almost as if nothing 
matters except for the tasks in the cockpit. 
Golf is also very relaxing even though it can be more than frustrating 
at times. I never read when I was younger but am beginning to 
realize what I was missing... I enjoy reading books that will teach me 
something: ethics, morals, facts, opinions... I like Bill O' Reilly and Keith 
Olbermann. I think they're hilarious and equally pompous, arrogant, and 
cynical, just in their own different ways. It's fun to watch them both on 
the same day and see their contrasting opinions and ways of presenting 
their arguments... Olbermann makes me laugh more, but O' Reilly makes 
me laugh harder.
The future seems daunting and scary. I want to study for the MAT and 
see what I can do with that, maybe teach in the years after college until 
life falls into alignment (will it ever?) I used to be heavily interested in 
politics and government, but that passion has since faded; not to say that I 
don't vote, but it's just too hard to follow these days!

JUSTIN MICHAELSON
My name is Justin J. Michaelson, but most of my friends call me J-Mike. 
When I was a freshman I pledged the fraternity Kappa Kappa Delta and 
the name calling began. At first I loathed this shortened version of my 
given name but have learned, over time, to appreciate and accept it. 
I was born in Madrid, Espana on December 23, 1987. My parents were 
in the Air Force and we traveled a lot as I was growing up. After Madrid, 
we moved to Germany where we lived until I was about 4 or 5 and then 
we moved back stateside to a military town called Abilene, Texas. My 
younger sister, Jania Nichelle, was born in Abilene and to this day we 
are pretty close. We later moved to San Antonio for a year before finally 
settling in Lockhart, Tx (aka, small town Texas) when I was in the 5th 
grade. Yes, I know Lockhart is know for its Bar-Be-Que, but you try 
living there! 
I am now a senior (although I will be graduating in Dec 2010 and not 
May 2010) and I'm studying Political Science and Communication. 
I pretty much despise all things political and found the glorious 
communication department a bit late in the game, thus the extra semester 
of study. My most immediate goals are to graduate and work for the 
HEB grocery company in their PR offices here in San Antonio. 
Some things that bring me joy are, but are not limited to: Friends 
and Family, Music (currently listening to a playlist of Jay-Z and Lady 
GaGa), Good television (such as Weeds, Mad Men and True Blood) and 
Crap television (like the Real World and Flipping Out), Expertly mixed 
martini's, Mimosas on a Sunday and Cheap Lone Star Light, Backpacking 
and camping, traveling (to a nearby town or across the world), all things 
Spain and particularly Madrid, Concerts and great food!

ALYSON MILLER
Hey y'all! So this is my blog for the Lennox Seminar class I'm taking at 
Trinity University. My name is Aly Miller, and I'm a sophomore and a 
Communication major/Art History minor at Trinity University. I'm from 
Fort Worth, TX, and I'm (at the moment) 19, although I turn 20 in 
about...two and a half hours. Which is weird.
I'm taking this class because, well, it sounded interesting. I didn't really 
know what to expect when I came to the class and I'm still not sure what 
to expect, but we're watching Dr. Horrible's Sing-a-long-Blog in class, so I 
feel like that's a good sign. While I don't know much as of now about any 
of the topics we will be discussing, I am excited to learn more.
In my spare time I like doing pretty average stuff—reading, watching 
way too much TV (current obsessions include Dollhouse, How I Met Your 
Mother, Big Bang Theory, Gossip Girl, Lost, Ugly Betty...plus all the shows 
I watch on DVD), playing video games occasionally, watching movies, 
listening to music, and making cookies.
Once upon a time, in a generally unattractive land called Houston, 
Texas, a little girl was born. Her mother was pleased to count the correct 
number of limbs and phalanges, and delighted in hearing the healthy 
sound of crying. What she was not prepared for, however, was the oozing 
wound located right on the back of the child's head. The doctor threw 
some papers at her to sign away liability for the child's wound, and no 
explanation was ever given as to what the cause might have been. 
As the mother slept of the pain medication she begged for all through 
delivery, her husband decided to get the naming of the little girl over with 
(unfortunately without the input of the slumbering mother). So, just in 
time for dinner on the eve of May 30, 1990, Robin Halliday Murdoch 
officially entered the world. The little girl grew up healthy and happy, the 
seeping wound becoming nothing but an irritating scar always evoking 
the reaction of "Ohhhh! That explains a lot...." 
It's always interesting when people readily jump to the conclusion that 
your personality was formed through some sort of severe head injury. But 
that's my life, and I'm not quite sure whether or not these assumptions 
are correct. Needless to say, the past nineteen years and eight months have 
been extremely interesting.
My family is slightly insane. Perhaps not in the clinical sense, but they 
definitely tip the strange scale in a way that frightens some. My dad is 
a geophysicist with an affinity for sarcasm and jokes that nobody who 
doesn't have a ludicrous amount of random knowledge. My mother 
carries on intense conversations with her pets, one of which regularly 
responds. My 24 year old brother... still lives at home. We have two birds 
(and by "we" I mean my mother has acquired them from people who 
ROBIN MURDOCH
Reality Hackers : Appendices : Participants 271
didn't want them anymore and we are all forced to coexist with them) 
named Charlie and Lola. Charlie has about three or four years on me 
and is a sulfur crested umbrella cockatoo. He spends his days flying freely 
around the kitchen, and going in for the attack whenever I need to eat 
a meal. Lola, an African grey, possesses a more pleasant demeanor, and 
has the added trait of speech. Her repertoire includes "You're a wizard, 
Harry", "I'm a gangster", the creak of the door, the phone ring, giggling, 
names, and "I'm Afrikin Grey" among many others. 
We also have Biscuit, the cat who followed my mom home from a walk 
and never left.... This is the house i grew up in. Insanity surrounding me 
on all sides, and death dropping in from above, attempting to scalp me 
while a little voice from the other room screams out lines from Harry 
Potter. My little madhouse. Ain't no place I'd rather be.
When not entertaining homicidal birds, I enjoy long walks on the beach, 
romance novels, and sacrificing virgins to pagan gods. I spend my time 
between sacrifices experiencing as much musical amazement as I possibly 
can. Though I have absolutely no musical talent (three failed attempts 
to play insturments even close to decently has told me this) I have a true 
passion for music. My iPod is one of my most important assets, though 
the lifespan of electronics once they reach my possession tends to be 
relatively short. I have a physical incapability to keep cell phones and 
iPods working for longer than a year. No matter what happens, death 
finds them. Sometimes in painfully ironic ways. 
Here at Trinity, I am a communication major, a member of Zeta Chi 
sorority, and often wear false facial hair around campus. I enjoy my 
friends, my classes, and my professors. Unfortunately, I have no real idea 
of what I want to do once I leave this place.... But I intend on making 
large amounts of money to avoid ever having to do real housework of any 
kind. And I feel that I have now officially exhausted my ability to write 
about myself.

AARON PASSER
My name is Aaron Passer and I am from Omaha, NE. Go BIG RED! I 
have lived in Omaha my entire life and I attended the same small private 
school from Kindergarten through 12th grade. While growing up I 
participated in Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts, and when I was 16 I became 
an Eagle Scout. Through my years of scouting I have developed a love 
for the outdoors. I have been backpacking all across the United States 
and even a few places overseas. To me there is nothing better than a night 
spent camping in the wilderness. 
I also got involved with sports at an early age. As a youngster in Nebraska 
I played soccer when there wasn't snow on the ground and I swam when 
there was. In high school I played football in the fall, swam in the winter, 
and golfed in the spring (we didn't have a soccer team so I opted for golf). 
Out of the three I achieved most success in golf. As a starter all four 
years I helped our team win 3 district titles and 1 state-runner up trophy. 
Besides being a big sports nut I am also a concert and music junkie. I 
have been to several different music festivals across the U.S. including 
Lollapalooza in Chicago and Austin City Limits (ACL) in Austin. 
I am, what many in the online community would consider a noob when 
it comes to the world of blogging. Never have I had the unquenchable 
desire to spill my thoughts and ideas out into the reality that has become 
the Internet. With that said, I know find myself writing this blog. 
Though reluctant at first, I am excited about the potential our blogs 
have to expand class discussions and help facilitate collaboration for 
class projects. It should be a fun semester. I am a junior majoring in 
accounting, minoring in french, and am looking in to getting a minor in 
communication also. I am also a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. 
While wasting time browsing this morning I came across a page relevant 
to class and Southland Tales. It's a list of the most "memorable" fictional 
drugs used in movies and television, and Liquid Karma made the cut. It 
doesn't give too much deep insight into the effects of the drug, but it 
gives a nice overview if you were at all confused. You can find the page 
by Googling the phrase “fictional drugs in movies and television” with the 
words “liquid karma.”

MARICELA RIOS
My name is Maricela Rios, and I am a Sophomore at Trinity University, 
majoring in communications with a art/ art history minor. I am from San 
Antonio, Texas and have lived here all of my life. I have a politically active 
family. My father is a politician in San Antonio and ran for Congress in 
1995. I graduated from Incarnate Word High School in 2008. I played 
tennis throughout high school, and taught summer camps. I was an intern 
for the San Antonio Artist Foundation before I started college. I enjoy 
dark room photography along with digital photography and studio art.
I just recently decided on a major this year, and I am happy with my 
decision. I hope to apply to law school when I graduate, and am currently 
looking for another internship for this upcoming summer. I plan to go 
abroad next spring to perfect my bilingual abilities, mainly Spanish/
English.
I am a member of Gamma Chi Delta Sorority. This sorority has made 
my time at Trinity truly memorable. Gamma Chi Delta is responsible 
for organizing the Concert for the Cure that benefits the Cancer Society. 
It is a privilege to be able to contribute with Gammas to that particular 
fundraiser.
I don't know much about reality hacking. But so far the class readings 
have sparked my interest. I look forward to the in depth class discussion 
and hearing the opinions of other class members.

RAELLE SMILEY
My name is Raelle Smiley. I am a sophomore at Trinity University. I am 
from Austin, Texas and have lived there most of my life. I was born in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania but moved to Austin when my father was hired 
to do restoration on the glass in the capitol dome. I graduated in 2008 
from Westlake High School. I am a Communication major at Trinity. 
I have been swimming since I was five years old and swam at Trinity last 
year and for part of this year. I currently hold the school record for the 
1000 freestyle. Now I train for open water swims and love working out. 
My family is very active, and both of my parents ride bicycles. I spent 
some time in high school teaching swim lessons and would love to do that 
again sometime, it is very rewarding to see your hard work pay off and to 
give kids the confidence to swim! 
I am a member of Gamma Chi Delta Sorority at Trinity. For me, 
Gammas is one of the best things about being at Trinity, outside of the 
academic opportunities. Being a member of a sorority has given me the 
opportunity to be involved in a variety of service events and things such 
as the Reflections Body Image Program which originated at Trinity among 
the local sororities. 
This summer I will be working as an intern for the company, ROSS 
Communications in Austin. I interviewed for the position over winter 
break and was just informed that I got the position. I think this will be 
a great opportunity for me and give me an idea of what working in the 
professional world will be like. 
I look forward to being involved in the Lennox seminar and experiencing 
all of the unique opportunities we will have as members of this class. I 
hope to get to know everyone and share our knowledge and skills when it 
comes to the group projects!

My name is Andrew Truelove. I'm 20 years old and am a sophomore at 
Trinity University. I'm planning on a major in Communication and a 
minor in Music. I was born in Houston, Texas, but since my dad works 
for Shell, I moved around a lot growing up. Up until the year 2000, this 
mostly involved moving back and forth between Texas and Louisiana, but 
when I was ten, we were transferred to the Netherlands where I remained 
until I graduated from high school. Holland was nice enough. If there's 
anything I can say about the whole Dutch experience it's that they know 
how to make a pancake there. That and you should never go to the 
country on New Year's Eve. It's the only day of the year where fireworks 
are legal, which means they like to go to town with their explosives.
My family at the moment is living in Calgary, sort of. My dad's in the 
process of moving the family to Abu Dhabi thanks to another transfer. 
Shell is loaning him out to the UAE national oil company or something 
to that extent, and the rest of my family is following him. Well technically, 
my older brother who is in the navy is stationed in Florida, and I have 
a sister going to school in Kentucky, so we've still got a good number of 
people staying in the Western hemisphere.
As far as my interests go, I'm not exactly sure where to begin. I have a lot 
of movies on me at my dorm, so I guess you could say I'm into that. I've 
got everything from Goodfellas to Good Burger, which may not exactly be 
a good thing. I got a lot of James Bonds here at Trinity, and the complete 
collection at home. If you ask me, there isn't really a movie series better 
than Bond. Sure Star Wars has a strong following and the Lord of the Rings
may be superior as far as writing and visual effects go, and yes, the James 
Bond series did give the world Sheriff J.W. Pepper (I'm sorry), but I still 
like it. 
With music, I'm a Beatles fan. No better band exists. Only the greatest 
musicians in the world could name a song "Everybody's Got Something 
to Hide Except for Me and my Monkey." Honorable mention goes to ZZ 
Top for beard related qualifications. And finally, my favorite television 
show has got to be Arrested Development. Really, there's always money in 
the banana stand.
I'm not exactly sure what else I can say. I'm a pretty quiet guy, but that 
should be obvious to anyone who's ever met me. I like to listen and take 
in what the world around me has to offer, or something like that. I've 
been told I have a dry, offbeat sense of humor, but I'm not sure how true 
that is. In any case, if you're reading this, that either means you're in 
my class or you are some stalker reading the pages of random people. If 
the former is the case, it's good to meet you, in an indirect, completely 
impersonal way. If you're the latter, I really live in Guam and my actual 
name is Pedro Hasselbrock. Stalk me there.

RICHARD BARTLE
“Biography”
Richard Allan Bartle was born in Ripon1, England, on Sunday, 10th 
January, 1960. His family (mother, father, younger brother) moved in 
1963 to the small (population 7,000) Yorkshire seaside town of Hornsea, 
where Richard attended the local school and did all the other usual things 
that growing up involves.
Richard's interests in gaming go back a long way. His father was an 
enthusiastic player of all boardgames, and soon had his two sons just 
as interested as he. Hornsea is quite remote as English towns go, and 
its social life can be most succinctly described by the word "none", so 
Richard sought out like-minded games-players among his friends at 
school, later expanding his horizons by playing games postally. He began 
a small gamers' magazine for his local group of fellow players, which acted 
as a prototype for a national zine he ran for the two years prior to his 
going to University. Both these projects gave him a grounding in written 
English rarely seen among today's computer programmers (or, come to 
that, today's game authors!).
The purchase by mail-order in 1975 of one of the first sets of Dungeons 
and Dragons rulebooks to reach the UK married together Richard's 
gaming and SF/fantasy interests. He and his brother had developed several 
informal role-playing gaming systems themselves, but none in the domain 
of Tolkienesque fantasy, and none with the depth of the D&D rules. 
Nightly D&D sessions soon became a regular thing among Hornsea's 
dedicated group of gamers.
Being some distance from a large town, the local school couldn't 
easily organise trips to visit computer installations, and therefore was 
granted the special privilege of having a subsidised phone connection 
to the County Council's own timesharing system. This meant that 
computer access was actually better than for most schools in the UK. 
Richard therefore got an early chance to learn programming, which he 
immediately put to use by writing (and getting published) a single-player 
programmed-text book (you know the sort: "if you wish to open the door 
immediately, go to 19C; to knock first, go to 7F; to run like hell, go to 
24A").
At school, Richard passed all his examinations without problem, but 
almost always relying on flair rather than hard work and revision. This 
was nevertheless quite sufficient to win him a place at Essex University 
in 1978, where he registered to study Mathematics. He switched to 
Computer Science at the end of the (common) first year, however, because 
"there were people better than me at Mathematics". His subsequent first class honours degree was (and, I gather, still is) the highest ever recorded 
in Essex University's Department of Computer Science. He stayed on to 
take a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, eventually taking up a lectureship in 
the subject (which, at the time, made him the youngest member on the 
academic staff in the whole of the University).
4.1 Richard Bartle. Currently a lecturer 
at Essex University, Dr. Richard Bartle 
co-authored the world’s first virtual 
world as a college undergraduate in 1978. 
A former university lecturer in artificial 
intelligence, he is an influential writer 
on all aspects of virtual world design 
and development. As an independent 
consultant, he has worked with almost 
every major online gaming company in the 
U.K. and the U.S. over the past 20 years, 
transforming an undergraduate research 
project into a multi-billion dollar 
industry. His book Designing Virtual 
Worlds is widely viewed as a “tour de 
force of virtual world design.”
278 Reality Hackers : Appendices : Participants
In his first full week as an undergraduate, Richard had met Roy Trubshaw 
- a brilliant programmer in the year above Richard's. Roy was thinking of 
writing a computerised fantasy game, and was impressed by what he saw 
in Richard's programmed-text book. He introduced Richard to the game 
Adventure (a transcript of which Richard had seen the previous year in 
a postal games magazine), and soon after hit upon the idea of writing a 
similar game which would allow several people to share the game world at 
the same time. He called his creation MUD and devoted the remainder of 
his undergraduate career to writing it. Richard was on hand with a ready 
supply of suggestions and ideas for Roy to incorporate into the game.
Roy had the shell of his third version of MUD running by the end of his 
course, but didn't have time to complete the rest of the game. He passed 
it to Richard, who added perhaps 75% of what constituted the final 
program. Roy had the "engine" working, but it didn't do much; Richard 
enhanced it, and employed it to manage a fully-realised game world.
Through MUD's success, Richard met a book publisher called Simon 
Dally. Simon commissioned a book from Richard (Artificial Intelligence 
and Computer Games;, Century Communications, London, 1985), 
and the two became friends. Along with Roy, they formed a company, 
"MUSE", to market MUD. In his spare time, Richard completely 
redesigned the entire MUD system from scratch, then wrote it anew 
himself. The new game was dubbed MUD2 by its players (although 
formally it should be MUD4). Roy's MUDs had certain limitations 
that meant some of the more complex concepts that it transpired rôle playing games required were either difficult to express or necessitated 
large amounts of surgery to the MUD program itself. MUD2 addressed 
these issues by having its own fully empowered programming language, 
MUDDLE, specifically intended to be used for writing MUD-like games 
but strong enough to be used for general programming (you could write 
the MUDDLE compiler in MUDDLE if so inclined). So flexible was the 
design for MUDDLE that it's still very much in use today.
Richard left Essex University in 1987 to work on MUD2 full time. 
In 1989, Simon got manic depression and committed suicide, leaving 
MUSE in a thoroughly awful mess. Although the company survived this, 
the writing was on the wall. These days, it's little more than a place-holder 
for various pieces of MUD-related intellectual property.
Richard gave up working for MUSE full-time in 2000, to head up the 
online games division of dot com start-up Gameplay. Sadly, the company 
rather squandered its resources, and all that was left after the dot com bust 
was a rump that sold games by post.
Richard switched to consultancy, which he'd always done in the past but 
not very regularly. In between assignments, he wrote the world's first book 
on the design of MUDs, Designing Virtual Worlds. Published in 2003, 
DVW rapidly became the standard work for anyone developing, studying 
or playing MUDs (or MMORPGs, MOOs, MU*s, PWs or any of the 
other acronyms variously applied to this kind of software these days). He 
is also one of the authors of the popular research blog Terra Nova.
4.2 The original Dungeons and Dragons.
Published by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson 
in 1974, the Dungeons and Dragons became 
a cultural phenomenon and is the world’s 
most well-known role-playing game. 
Reality Hackers : Appendices : Participants 279
Richard returned to his Essex University roots in 2002, teaching on its 
nascent computer games degree. He was appointed Visiting Professor in 
2004. Currently, he therefore spends his time juggling teaching duties and 
research with the occasional demands of his consultancy business. He still 
plays a lot of games, too!
Richard lives near Colchester in Essex, with his wife, Gail, and daughters 
Jennifer (born July 1990) and Madeleine (born March 1994).
4.3 Lecturing in Everquest II. In 2006, 
Richard Bartle delivered a guest lecture 
to Trinity University students enrolled 
in a seminar on virtual world research 
methods. Rather than flying from the 
United Kingdom to Texas, he met with the 
students in the virtual world of Norrath.

ANNALEE NEWITZ
“Biography”
Currently, I am the lead editor for science fiction and science blog io9—it 
went live in January 2008, and in 2010, over 2 million people read it 
every month. I am also a freelance writer, contributing work to Wired,
Popular Science, New Scientist, and other excellent publications. During 
2004 and most of 2005, I was the policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation. In 2006 I published a book based on my doctoral research. 
It's called Pretend We're Dead, and it was published by Duke University 
Press. In early 2007, Seal Press published a collection of essays I co-edited 
called She's Such a Geek—yes, it's about female nerds.
My work has also appeared in magazines and papers such as: The 
Washington Post, New York Magazine, Technology Review, Hilobrow, The 
San Francisco Chronicle, 2600, The Believer, Nerve, The Utne Reader 
Online, Alternative Press Review, New York Press, The San Francisco Bay 
Guardian, The Silicon Valley Metro, and several academic journals and 
anthologies.
From 1999 to 2008, I wrote a weekly syndicated column called 
Techsploitation, which was about the ways that media mutates and 
reiterates the problems of everyday life.
Formerly, I was the culture editor at The San Francisco Bay Guardian and 
in 2002 I was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship, which 
allowed me to spend the 2002-2003 academic year as a research fellow at 
MIT.
I was born just after the New Left died and shortly before abortion was 
legalized. Growing up in the planned suburban community of Irvine, 
California, I was exposed at a young age to the clash between Information 
Era techno-utopianism and the disturbing realities of middle-class greed, 
cynicism, and sexual repression.
When I moved to Berkeley, California, I began what became a ten-year 
odyssey through the land of academia. During that time, I founded a 
webzine, Bad Subjects, which is still going strong; I published two books, 
White Trash: Race and Class in America (Routledge, 1997) and The Bad 
Subjects Anthology (NYU Press, 1998); and in 1998 I graduated from 
UC Berkeley with a Ph.D. in English and American Studies. I wrote my 
dissertation on images of monsters, psychopaths, and capitalism in 20th 
Century American pop culture. After working for a year as an adjunct 
professor, I decided to pursue the career I loved most: writing.
I had been freelancing since 1996, mostly for alternative weeklies and on line magazines, and in early 1999, I began to write for a living full-time. 
Having spent so many years studying pop culture and media in academia, 
I was naturally interested in writing about these topics as a journalist. And 
that's what I've been doing for a decade now.

EKATERINA SEDIA
“Interview by Annalee Newitz”
In the introduction to her interview with Ekaterina Sedia, Annalee Newitz 
wrote: “A couple of weeks ago, I told you about a haunting new novel from 
Ekaterina Sedia called Alchemy of Stone. It’s the tale of a female robot named 
Mattie who works as a chemist on an alternate world where the industrial 
revolution is in full swing. Though the engineer who made Mattie has set her 
free, he refuses to give her the key that winds her mechanical heart. All Mattie 
wants is control of her own key and a peaceful place to work, but instead she 
gets caught up in a workers’ revolt and her life begins to unravel. The novel 
was so thought-provoking that I tracked Sedia down and asked her some 
questions about female robots, politics, and magic.” 
Ekaterina Sedia and Annalee Newitz are at the forefront of this decade’s 
science fiction revival. Annalee interviewed Ekaterina on August 4, 2008 for 
the science fiction blog io9.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported license.
One thing that makes Alchemy of Stone different from many other 
books about robots is that Mattie is more vulnerable than the 
humans around her. She doesn’t have superpowers, and is in fact quite 
breakable. Why did you choose to take her character in that direction? 
Along those same lines, what abilities does Mattie have that humans 
don’t? You mention at one point that her eyes are much better than 
humans’—are there other super-human abilities she has?
I noticed that in much of SF, written or visual, machines are portrayed 
as benign or menacing, but almost always as more powerful than people. 
To me it seems like a bad case of hubris, where we believe that we are 
capable of creating something more perfect than us, even if it will destroy 
us in the end. Of course, anyone who had ever owned a computer, driven 
a car or operated a toaster knows that it’s not true—machines break a 
lot, redundancies fail, and basically without constant repair and upkeep, 
machines do not fare too well.
Mattie was in part a reaction to the myth of superpowered machines 
(Terminator or Six Million Dollar Man or HAL) as a more realistic 
alternative, but also as a more interesting protagonist. Plus, I believe 
that we care about characters not because of their perfection but because 
of their vulnerabilities. Mattie cannot heal, she needs to be repaired 
constantly—and this is really the crux of her existence, because she wants 
to be able to survive on her own. Even her eyes, which were made to SEE 
better are still glass, breakable, and can be taken away from her at any 
time. As for other superpowers—she is a very good alchemist. And she is 
strong when working properly. That’s about it.
Though Mattie is an outcast among humans, her life has been 
privileged enough that she doesn’t fit in with the proletarian 
revolutionaries either. Do you think Mattie has a political position of 
her own?
4.5 Alchemy of Stone. Published in 2008, 
Ekaterina Sedia’s novel was identified by 
the blog io9 as one of the top twenty 
science fiction novels of the previous 
decade. Sedia’s prose has been described 
as “haunting and magical,” and reviewers 
praise her knack for “leaving readers to 
reach their own conclusions about the 
proper balance of tradition and progress 
and what it means to be alive.”

You are absolutely right. Despite her being fairly wealthy, her wealth can 
be easily taken away from her, by whoever is in power—bourgeoisie or 
proletariat or aristocracy. Everything she has, she has because of someone 
else’s kindness. So in that sense, she is in her own camp, simply because 
people around her are unlikely to accept her as anything other than an 
inanimate object with no rights. If you were to ask her position, I don’t 
think she would have a very defined or politically astute one—except for 
believing that people ought to be allowed to live the way they see fit, and 
that she ought to be allowed the same.
Despite the fact that you set this novel in a semi-magical world, 
the chemistry that Mattie does feels very realistic. She does a lot 
of repetitive tasks to isolate elements, and generally acts as if she’s 
working in a typical chemistry lab. Do you think there is magic in 
Mattie’s world, or just events that don’t have a scientific explanation 
yet?
Souls and the Soul-Smoker [a character who can absorb other people’s 
souls] are the only explicitly magical things in this book; at least, this was 
my intent. The rest of it is based on the supposition that alchemy and the 
Doctrine of Signatures actually work—which are not quite magic, those 
are just theories that had been demonstrated wrong in our world. So they 
just have different laws of the natural world, which doesn’t really count as 
magic, does it? Even the gargoyles appear, to me at least, as creatures that 
are different but notsupernatural.
There were a lot of moments in this novel where it felt like Mattie’s 
struggles to be accepted as an alchemist mirror the struggles of a lot 
of women who want to be accepted as scientists (especially in male dominated fields). Were you trying to touch on those issues, or more 
broadly on the issue of inequality between men and women?
I am a scientist in real life, so yes, of course I am aware of discrimination 
and inequality that still exists in most scientific fields, and it colored my 
depiction of Mattie. At the same time, I did try to talk about inequality 
and oppression in their many forms—not just gender, but also class, 
ethnicity, and, in Mattie’s case, chemical composition. Each of those is 
an added burden, and yes, I think women who work in male-dominated 
fields will be able to relate to that sense of constant swimming upstream 
and the simplest things being a chore when you just want to do your job 
and not to be challenged every time you take a breath. Most of us could 
do with a bit less overcoming, I think.
What are you working on right now? Any new novels in the works?
Oh my, yes. I have another one coming out in 2009, The House of 
Discarded Dreams. I also just finished a Victorian Gothic YA based in 
real-world alchemy; it is about a girl and her salamander. I am currently 
working on an alternate history/steampunk novel taking place in Russia 
just before the Crimean War, in which the British and the Ottoman 
Empires team up against Russian-Chinese alliance. So it’s basically 
Russian steampunk with wuxia. And British spies.
4.6 Lungworts and the doctrine of 
signatures. The phrase “doctrine of 
signatures” refers to the belief that 
God marked natural creations with a 
divine signature providing a clue about 
the object’s purpose. For example, 
the lungwort plants were once used 
as a treatment for pulmonary illness 
because the spots on the leaves reminded 
physicians of infected, ulcerated lungs.

STEVEN SHAVIRO
“Interview by Zoran Roško”
This interview was originally published in the Croatian journal QUORUM. 
It was translated and reprinted by the 16 Beaver Group on February 5, 2005.
Zoran Roško: Mr Shaviro, the subtitle of your book Doom Patrols 
is "a theoretical fiction about postmodernism." What is your 
general attitude toward that invisible continent of time called 
postmodernism? Is it maybe just another great narrative, great slogan, 
ideology, late capitalism's shock absorber, just one arbitrary cultural 
mode among many others...? Is our life (or your life in the USA) really 
postmodern, or is it maybe just an exciting possibility to think, write 
and talk about? Or something else altogether?
After overusing the word "postmodernism" in Doom Patrols, I have 
tried to stop using it entirely in what I am writing now (Stranded in the 
Jungle). This is mostly because the word has come to mean too many 
different things; everyone has their own definition, and the word has been 
stretched so broadly in the last few years. I still think, though, that what I 
wrote in Doom Patrols remains valid. If the word has any use, it is not to 
designate a particular style of writing or philosophy, but a social/political/
economic situation that we all are in. A situation of global brand names, 
multinational corporations affecting every area of life, and the use of 
relatively new, and increasingly ubiquitous electronic, digital technologies 
(not to mention bio-technologies, which are also digital since they are 
based in DNA)—all of this all the more so now that we are living in a 
post-Communist, post-Cold War era.
Zoran Roško: It seems that you object to the typical pomo leitmotif 
concerning the importance of language and language games. What are 
the limits of that idea? And, related to that, it seems that you dislike 
the Lacanian approach. Why?
Of course language is an important part of what makes us human. But I 
think it is an exaggeration to say that everything is language, everything 
is textuality, etc. That is why I don't accept the idea of some overarching 
"Symbolic Order" as the Lacanians do (as far as I can tell; in Lacan and 
followers of Lacan like Žižek, I find what they say about the impossible 
Real far more interesting than what they say about the Symbolic or the 
Imaginary). Instead, I would want to emphasize the multitude of different 
"language games" (Wittgenstein): language works in all sorts of different 
ways, it is involved in many different forms of life, and it is involved in all 
sorts of different ways with other, non-linguistic factors (bodies, emotions, 
architectures and other organizations of space, images, sounds, etc). So 
I am not opposed to talking about language games, understanding that 
Wittgenstein says they are always not just linguistic, but also involve 
forms of life; I find this sort of formulation, or for that matter Foucault's 
notion of the materiality of multiple discourses, more to the point than 
theories that exalt the power of the Signifier.

Zoran Roško: Does pomo consist in negotiating various discoursive 
strategies, are signifiers really so important? Why would it be 
that FREE play of signifiers is preferable if such a play is always 
regressive,i.e. purely theoretical. Isn't the idea of infinite play of 
signifiers an indicator of just the opposite - that that play isn't 
important at all, because all the important decisions and choices 
are, by it's immanent logic, being "made" somewhere else (so po mo would be just a big cover for all the important stuff behind 
the scene of language)? "Our" emotions, joys, pains, decisions, 
fascinations, tastes are always already some kind of performances, 
so the MEANINGS of the performance X may be infinitely multiple 
but that doesn't undo the "finite" Singularity (mystery) of that 
performance. Is the deferral of the meaning (and identity) of that X 
identical to the defferal of performativity of that X? Why should that 
performance be dependable on the identity of X in the first place: 
if the X is the same thing with or without its identity, why is it so 
important to deconstruct its identity? Isn't a pomo just some kind 
of secondary narcissism, a compulsive ego-trip, a paranoic rapture 
(ego's fear that it doesn't exist is returning in the inverted form, as a 
joy in nonidentity)? Is pomo just another narcissistic illusion? Is there 
anything BEYOND ego?
There are lots of issues being raised here, I cannot answer them all. I 
would go on from what I said above about why I don't find it useful 
to focus on signifiers—there are probably better ways to talk about 
constraints vs the infinitude of potential play, than one that is focused 
on signifiers. Following from that, I could agree with what you are 
suggesting, translating it into the idea that presence/absence of identity 
is less important than concretely grasping the multitide of performances. 
As for ego and narcissism, I am inclined to say that one never gets totally 
BEYOND ego, it is always there, but by the same token one is never 
ENTIRELY narcissistic, there is always otherness too, the ego is never 
total—which for me suggests yet again that the best response might be 
to learn how to talk in a different register altogether, than one that asks 
whether there is a self, whether the self gets "deconstructed" or not, etc. It 
may well be that there are other dimensions of "postmodern" experience 
that it is more interesting to address.
Zoran Roško: I'm very interested for that "different registers" 
and different formats of experience ( exemplified in transpersonal 
ideas of Ken Wilber and Stanislav Grof for example). Although the 
postmodenists are supposedly open to ontological multiplicity it 
seems that they are open ONLY to multiplicities that are rationally 
accountable (so the paradox is the only liminal tool for them), and 
very UNRESPONSIVE toward the "altered" (non-reductive, non united) states of consciousness—understanding here that these 
states are not only the other "discourses" (even in a foucauldian 
way, like you said) but the completely other registers (levels) and 
formats of being (Peter Koslowski said that pomo is a "mysticism 
without mystics"). For example, Žižek is arrogantly designating all 
this different reality markup languages "obscurantism", although, 
as I see it, he is actually preparing a ground for a mystic play of life 
4.8 Doom Patrol (Crawling from the 
Wreckage). In the late 1980s, Grant 
Morrison initated a legendary run on the 
comic book Doom Patrol. His work served as 
partial inspiration for Steven Shaviro’s 
equally groundbreaking work Doom Patrols: 
A Theoretical Fiction about Postmodernism 
and Literature. (See www.dhalgren.com/
Doom/ to read the full text of Shaviro’s 
book on-line.)

(and it's his blind spot, I think). But it seems that these new cyber postmodernists are much more open to gnostic/shamanistic aspects of 
"multiplicity". You have that text about LSD, so how "relevant" that 
altered states (from shamanistic to mystical and "paranormal") are 
for you? Do you find any appeal in the New Age excitement with new 
levels of being and with human mutations and transhumanism. Are 
we evolving/mutating into anything (new)?
I have a somewhat nuanced and skeptical answer to this question. Yes, 
I am interested in other, "altered" states or levels of being, but at the 
same time I am suspicious of attempts to give these other states some 
sort of objectified reality. The chapter I wrote in Stranded in the Jungle 
about LSD exemplifies this. I wanted to describe the affective experience 
involved, but without making any transcendent or metaphysical claims 
for that experience. This was in deliberate opposition to the way that 
psychedelic intellectuals from Timothy Leary to Terence McKenna have 
tried to use their experiences with mind-expanding drugs as the grounds 
for all sorts of cosmic theories. So I am equally opposed to those people 
who would inflate these limit-experiences (with drugs, sex, mysticism, 
dying, etc), and those who would simply dismiss them. Actually I think 
this attitude is not just "postmodern"; it goes back to Georges Bataille, 
who insisted on an "inner experience" that was its own sole authority, 
and yet that "expiated itself", disavowed its own authority. When we 
"translate" these experiences into discursive meanings, we thereby falsify 
them; the problem is to preserve the experiences without appropriating 
them into such meanings.
Zoran Roško: You also have that text about the aliens? What's your 
interest in them? What can they not tell us that may be interesting, 
are they showing by not showing? Are they blinding us with light (one 
character in The X-Files said - "what is hidden in the light")?
In my chapter on alien abductions, I wanted, again, to get at some sort of 
affective core of the experiences as they have been reported, without either 
saying that "I want to believe" in the truth of the experiences (as Mulder 
wants to), nor just skeptically debunking them (because, even granted 
that they didn't "really" happen, the sense of lostness, of dislocation, 
of something that might be called "alienation" except that there is no 
wholeness to be alienated from—-all that still remains.
Zoran Roško: Can you shortly summarise the po-mo legacy, what 
is still alive in the "classic" works of Lyotard, Baudrillard, Deleuze, 
Lacan, Foucault...? May we say that something like the post postmodernism is on the horizon?
I am not sure how to answer this question (though it is a good question). 
Personally, I feel that I have learned a lot from these postmodern thinkers, 
and for that very reason I do not tend to read them much any more. Most 
of these people are now dead (all except for Baudrillard and Derrida) and 
I have assimilated them sufficiently that they do not seem 'new' to me 
any more. I have not really come across anything of similar weight among 
younger, more recent generations of philosophers (except perhaps for

Agamben)—this may just be my limitation, that I have not encountered 
the right texts. But for the most part what has inspired my more recently 
have been novels, films, music, etc, more than theoretical writing. I 
would say also, that even now as we enter the 21st century, we are still 
under the domination of 19th century thought. Most of contemporary, 
'postmodern' thought still refers back to the great 19th century thinkers: 
Nietzsche and Darwin above all. (Perhaps also to Marx and Freud—
Freud's major works, I know, come from the first few decades of the 
20th century, but his background and formation are still very much 19th 
century—but Marx and Freud are more the wellsprings of modernism 
than of postmodernism).
Zoran Roško: On your web-site we may find some information 
concerning your taste in fiction. In a way you are assocciated with the 
avant-pop sesibility. Is that just your private idiosincratic taste, or you 
can recommend those authors to the wider audiences, for example 
even in Croatia?
I don't always know how well the American fiction writers whom I like 
the best right now will travel in international contexts. The people who 
coined the term 'avant-pop' are my friends, and I like many of their 
works, but I think the term is more a marketing concept than an actual 
movement. I would say that, in the United States today, I don't find 
many of the writers who are more conservative aesthetically to be very 
interesting. But there are a lot of ways to be innovative, I don't think there 
is any unity among the writers I am interested in in this sense.
Zoran Roško: Are there any authors in the USA that share your views, 
or resemble your style, are you alone?
My aesthetic perspectives are not shared with, say, the major US 
intellectual journals, but I do not feel isolated, because I have lots of 
friends or people I share aesthetic affinities with, even if they don't 
publish in these major journals.
Zoran Roško: In croatian you cannot have non-gendered assertions, 
so when you say "I took a knife", it is either he or she that is speaking. 
So, what is the gender of the narrator in the "Kathy Acker" text 
(Doom Patrols)?
Actually I cannot give you a definitive answer to this from the point 
of view of how best to translate the text, because I quite deliberately 
took refuge in the fact that in English the first and second persons 
are not gender-marked, only the third person singular is. You could 
say equally well that the speaker is male (to the extent that the text 
is autobiographical—I do not claim to be doing Cixousian écriture 
feminine or anything like that), and female (to the extent that the text is 
build around quotations from Acker which are themselves paraphrases, 
translations, or deliberate rewritings and mistranslations, of quotations 
from texts by Laure).
4.10 Jean Says: You are Ze Real Thing. This 
illustration by Dan Archer, created for 
www.archcomix.com in 2010, pays homage to 
the philosopher’s famous observation that 
“Disneyland is presented as imaginary in 
order to make us believe that the rest is 
real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and 
the America surrounding it are no longer 
real, but of the order of the hyperreal 
and of simulation.” Shaviro takes up this 
issue in the Walt Disney chapter of his 
book Doom Patrols: A Theoretical Fiction 
about Postmodernism and Literature.
Reality Hackers : Appendices : Participants 287
Zoran Roško: My first reading of the "Kathy Acker" text was rather 
naive (it was my first encounter with Doom Patrols, without reading 
the introduction first). I thought that YOU were ACTUAL lover of 
Kathy Acker, and that possibility seemed exciting and sort of sad to me 
(considering what happened to "two of you guys" and Kathy herself). 
Only on the second thought, and especially after the conversation 
with Goran, the translator (who translated the text, to my surprise, 
as she-gendered) I recognized the undecidabilty of what is going on. 
Mybe I was just projecting myself into the text too much (in a way 
I "recognized" myself in a story, in an old fashioned reader's way). 
Now, what is that telling us? Who is that "being" in me that is doing 
an "identification", and unconciously wanting it? Just my ego? Kaja 
Silverman is talking about "idealization from a distance" and about 
constitutive role of identification with an (idealized) image for the 
making of ourselves and for the enjoyment. Mark Pesce said that 
giving a meaning to something is a MAGICAL act - so, can we find 
any magical-voyeuristic power in anything without that notorius being 
aka "ego" ( be it an illusion or not)? Maybe an ego is not so bad an 
invention after all! Maybe an ego is just the last stand of magic (and 
magical terror, of course) in a nonmagical age! In that case, question 
is - Who or What in us, or through us, is needing that magic, and for 
whose agenda is that magic lobbying for? Shuld we pay attention to 
what is that "being" telling us, should we belive our desires, or is it 
just something that we have to "overcome" and surpass with "better", 
cleverer reading of ourselves? Besides, have you ever met Kathy?
I will start answering this question backwards—yes, I knew Kathy 
Acker pretty well. She was an extraordinary person, I think, as well as 
a great writer; somebody who meant a lot to me and who taught me a 
lot. There is a chapter in Stranded in the Jungle which is my personal 
response to her death. The chapter which bears Acker's name in Doom 
Patrols is "autobiographical" in the sense that I am talking on some level 
about my own emotions; but I am also trying to channel these emotions 
through Acker's texts and the texts that she was already channelling and 
transforming. Which, I would say, is my way of projecting myself into the 
text—not (I hope) by idealizing and appropriating the text to my own 
ego-needs, but rather, to the contrary, by trying to discover what it is in 
"my own" inner experience that is already in a real sense impersonal or 
transpersonal. I'd even say that this is what is most uncanny and powerful 
about those moments which we classify as "aesthetic": that, far from 
reflecting us back to ourselves, they make us realize how much of ourselves 
really isn't our own, how much otherness already pervades us.
Zoran Roško: Are you familiar with the work of such "radical" 
thinkers as Hakim Bey, John Zerzan, Robert Cheatham ( from 
Perforations), Critical Art Ensemble, Avital Ronell, Robert Anton 
Wilson, Terence McKenna? Are there any authors that you think we 
MUST read ( besides Thomas Carl Wall, who is really wonderful )?
Tom Wall is a friend of mine, his work is great, and I am glad that you 
know about it and like it. Otherwise, I have read most of the people you 
mention, with varying degrees of interest and enjoyment, but none of

them have really affected or influenced me very strongly. I find Terence 
McKenna vastly entertaining, but I do not take his intellectual assertions 
very seriously. I don't know if there are any MUST-READS that I can 
name. The novels by younger (i.e. under the age of 40) English-language 
novelists that have delighted me the most in the last few years are 
Glamorama by Bret Easton Ellis and Slaughtermatic by Steve Aylett (I 
have no idea if either of these are known in Croatia).
Zoran Roško: You've been cyber-addict, what are your cyber-doses 
now, when the heroic era of the cyber-frontier turned out to be just 
another parcel of our ordinary virtual lives?
Yes, I think that being online is no longer a novelty for me; it has become 
just another taken-for-granted part of my life. The Web is where I first 
check when I am doing research or looking for information; it has become 
pretty much routine. Now that I have a fast connection that is always 
on, I even do things like checking the definition of a word in an online 
dictionary, because it seems less effort than getting out of my chair to 
take the print dictionary off the shelf. On the other hand, I don't spend 
as much time in MOOs or chat spaces as I once did; I think I got burned 
out on the intensity of it all. To live an active online social life takes up a 
lot of time as well as being emotionally draining. So usually I go to a cafe 
instead.
Zoran Roško: What is hot in the Seattle (alternative) cultural mileu 
now? And is there anything cool in the USA academic world?
Seattle had its moment of glory in the early 1990s with Nirvana and 
other bands; I don't think there is any local scene that is "hot" or "cool" 
or potentially influential like that now. The city and its surroundings 
have radically changed in the last couple of years, because of Microsoft, 
Amazon.com, Real.com, and all the other software and Internet 
companies. This basically means that the number of arrogant rich people 
has increased, to the detriment of everyone else and of the city in general. 
In academia, I don't really know what the trends are now, I more or less 
deliberately try to avoid contact with academic writing because I don't 
want it to affect or influence my own writing.
Zoran Roško: What are your experiences with the academic 
establishment and publishers, since you must have been some kind of 
freak to many of them (or not so)?
In fact, I have had bad experiences with academic publishers—ones who 
ended up not publishing my books—but I prefer not to name names. I 
welcomed the opportunity to have my last completed book, Doom Patrols, 
published by a non-academic press [Serpent's Tail]. But this is mostly 
because I am actively trying to write in a less academic prose style, and 
address a less academic audience.
Zoran Roško: Are you paranoic about anything? Are you a paranoia fan (in Pynchonland-style, or in the context of Jodi Dean's and Jerry 
Aline Flieger's texts about paranoia - if you've read them).
4.12 Bret Easton Ellis’ Glamorama (1998). 
Loosely linked to his other works, Bret 
Easton Ellis’ novel Glamorama brilliantly 
captured global consumer culture near the 
end of the Millennium. 
Reality Hackers : Appendices : Participants 289
Personally, I am not very paranoid. I am inclined to think that you don't 
need to invoke conspiracies to explain the vast quantity of stupidity, 
oppression, and injustice in the world; "business as usual" and the 
everyday functioning of corporations and bureaucracies is enough to 
account for it all. I've looked at Dean's and Flieger's books; I would 
agree that they are pointing to something that does have a real presence 
in contemporary popular culture, just because the pace and magnitude 
of technological change, combined with the power of elites, gives reasons 
why the idea of conspiracy is so prevalent in so many minds. I enjoy 
The X-Files, but I was a bigger fan of Chris Carter's other TV show, 
Millennium (I don't know whether this showed in Croatia; it only played 
in the US for 3 seasons, never got good ratings, and was then cancelled). 
Millennium was a little different than The X-Files, because its main trope 
was not conspiracy-theory paranoia, but a kind of religious mania and 
metaphysical anxiety. As for Pynchon: his most recent, and I believe, 
greatest book, Mason & Dixon, pretty much renounces the paranoia of 
Gravity's Rainbow.
Zoran Roško: In Croatia we've had only The X-Files on tv. If you are 
not paranoic enough, maybe that's so because you are information hysteric too much ( I'm just kidding ).What reviews, magazines and 
journals are you reading and like the most? Have you discovered 
some new exciting web-sites or e-journals lately. Are you a victim of 
the information overload yet, or, in other terms, are you capable to 
download the Silence?
I wonder whether information overload and The Silence aren't really the 
same thing-the excess of too much, and the subtlety of almost-nothing 
(since when all is silent you find yourself hearing the silence itself) might 
be the two interconnecting moebius-strip sides of the same thing.
Zoran Roško: Have you jumped to any "conclusions" considering net art, digital art, tele-art, hypertextual fiction (and the theory behind 
it, for example Roy Ascott's)? Do you consider it as the NEW BIG 
THING ?
I'd say we should always beware of the NEW BIG THING, which is 
usually just an effect of marketing. Or, to put the same idea differently, 
in a "postmodern" age where everything new is instantly commodified, 
where continual "innovation" is itself the way the system of control 
reproduces itself and thereby remains the same, that maybe the strategy to 
adopt is not one of being the next big thing, but of flying under the radar 
as it were, of moving so stealthily and so close to the ground that you 
don't get noticed.
Zoran Roško: In your texts, you are writing about My Bloody 
Valentine, Sonic Youth, Bjork, Prince etc and in this conversation you 
said that you are finding more inspiration in music than in theory, at 
least lately. In "Spasm" the Krokers said that "music rules today as 
a dominant ideogram of power.. [ that it is ] a real ruling labaratory 
of the age of sacrificial power... the key code of the postmodern 
body as a war machine" and that "sampler technology is the forward

mechanism of late capitalist culture". But Kodwo Eshun said that 
new music is the laboratory for the creation of NEW EMOTIONS for 
which there is no language yet (he means it positively). What is your 
opinion - are we just slaves to the rhythm (of cyborg money) or are we 
at last getting tuned to the real rhythm of "history" (whatever it's acid 
house of being turns out to be)?
It should be evident that I am on the side of Eshun, not on that of the 
Krokers. I don't think that the Krokers' politics are wrong, exactly; many 
of their warnings are indeed relevant, and I have no utopian delusions 
that the current cyber-euphoria is a movement of true liberation. Still, 
I don't think that is ALL there is to the story. Counter to Adorno and 
the Krokers, it isn't JUST alienation and cynical ruses of power: though 
these are never absent, they also aren't the full story. I do think that music 
(probably music is the privileged case today, but the same is possible in 
other cultural forms) is grasping, and concretely bringing into being, new 
emotions or new modes of being. Though I do not think this is "the real 
rhythm of 'history'"; there is no finality to it, it is rather just the continual 
creation of newness out of repetition (here I am channelling Deleuze 
channelling Bergson and Nietzsche).
Zoran Roško: Some authors are emphasizing the religious/spiritual/
gnostic aspect of (new) technologies ( tech-gnosis). Are you religious 
in any way? What will you be doing after you die?
I quite admired Eric Davis' book Techgnosis, which deals thoroughly and 
intelligently with all this. But I have to say that I myself don't have any 
sort of religious or spiritual longings that I am aware of. All that leaves me 
unmoved. I don't think I will be anywhere, or be doing anything, after I 
die.
Zoran Roško: I think that Baudrillard and you are the most exciting 
pomo theorists that I know, and, trying to find some parallel and 
opposition between two of you, I'm inclined to say that you are for 
the end of pomo just what Baudrillard was for it's beginning: alibi. 
You guys have made pomo - it's first, coital coming (to life), and 
it's second, postcoital coming (to death) - ontologically glamorous 
so that pomo looked like it's a natural born celebrity right at the 
spot (of its birth/death). So it seems that B. discovered an "ecstasy 
of communication" and that you discovered something like the 
postecstasy of noncommunication, i.e. postcoital tele-orgasm 
(excitement, or even sense, comes to us arbitrarily, randomly, madly, 
parasiticaly, just when we think that it is all gone and that there is 
nothing more to remember, pretend about or belive to). "Meaning" or 
willingness to live has nothing to do with the structure of that living. 
"Meaning" is digital (independent of the life to which it transfers 
the meaning) and demonic (outside of the interiority that is it's 
medium): meaning of life is a DIGITAL DEMON. We are ruled not 
by the spell of analog magic (layed bare and disenchanted by pomo 
deconstructions), but by the spell of digital magic - by the spell of joy 
that is alien to us, that comes from without. Meaning is here not to 
comfort us and save/deliver us but to devour us.Because of that, your

glamour is more dark, indie, carnal, fetishistic, scatological, bizzare 
and emotional, in one word - deadly: joy doesn't come dramatically, 
it comes like death, fatally, not to reward you or to flatter you, but 
to stop you and to punctuate you with destiny, to make you digital 
- made of ones of life and zeroes of its meaning. While B introduced 
puritanic, bright angels of ontological dadaism and dandysm (with 
some nostalgic shades), you've delivered us to angels of elctronic 
ontological disturbance (with lot of futuristic and post-apocalyptic 
extravaganza). Besides, I think that you help us to us recognize (since 
the life is a medium without a message) that pomo is ultimately about 
the perverted emotionality of being (what is the emotion if not the 
medium without a message): drag-queen of emotion turned into 
paradoxical thought. So, I think that pomo helped us to develop not 
an idea but the particular sensibility of life. So, pomo turns realities 
into virtualities, emotions into thoughts and by laying it bare shows 
us the next challenge: why are emotions so perversely powerful, why 
we can't live with or without them. Good old/new question. Is this 
crap?

Let the story beginning in the Spring of 1967. I am 14 years old and 
in 9th grade. It’s early evening and the doorbell rings at the suburban 
house in Binghamton, New York where I live with my mom and dad. 
It’s a group of my friends and they’re each carrying a plastic bag and 
looking mighty pleased. They come in, we shuffle into the guest room 
(where the record player is kept) and they show off their gatherings—
buttons (“Frodo Lives!” “Mary Poppins is a Junkie” “Flower Power”), 
beads, posters (hallucinatory), incense with a Buddha incense burner, 
and kazoos. A lonely looking newspaper lays at the bottom of the pile, as 
though shameful, the only item unremarked.
Without realizing the implications, I happen to throw side one of 
Between The Buttons on the player. Eventually, the song “Cool Calm and 
Collected” plays and a kazoo sounds through the speakers. In an instant, 
newly purchased kazoos are wielded and The Rolling Stones only-ever 
kazoo solo is joined by three wailing teenagers, bringing sudden shouts 
of objection from my famously liberal and tolerant Dad in the living 
room. It’s quickly determined that it’s late, Dad’s tired, and it’s time to 
send all kazoo-wielding teens packing. As each of the friends moves to 
retrieve his items, I grab the newspaper to see what it is. There are, I now 
see, two of them—two editions of something called “The Oracle.” It has 
hallucinatory visuals on the cover and boasts an interview with a member 
of The Byrds (David Crosby). Vinnie, who had bought it—but who, 
despite writing poetry—avoids any signifiers of intellectual curiosity as the 
teen status crushers that they are, feigns disinterest and gives the copies to 
me.
And that’s where it begins, this strange love affair with the periodical, 
particularly the periodical that has flair and style… where you can almost 
feel the energy and fun emanating off the pages.
I remember only one thing from the content inside those two Oracles 
and that’s David Crosby denying that he was “some kind of weird freak 
who fucks ten chicks a day.” That stuck in my mind. I didn’t know it was 
possible even to think that, much less print it, much less be in a position 
to find it necessary to deny being it!
Let the story continue some time in early 1969, I’m 16 and in my junior 
year at Binghamton Central High School. The student/youth protest 
movement has fired my imagination—and the more radical the better. 
The Columbia University takeover with obscenity screaming Mark Rudd! 
The French Revolution of May ’68! The armed black student takeover 
of the Cornell administration building, just 45 miles away in Ithaca! 
WoWeeee!
I wanted a piece of it. So I started a high school “underground 
newspaper”—The Lower Left Corner. Wanting to spring it on the school 
as a total surprise, I brought in only one co-conspirator (memory fails me, 
R. U. SIRIUS

Goffman, Sirius is wearing the latest

Singularity” t-shirt.

but he was more a collegian liberal type while I hung with the freaks.) 
Anyway, what we came up with was, I am sure, a completely lame and 
absurd piece of adolescent indignation. While college students revolted 
against the war, racism, and authoritarianism in school, we boiled it down 
to authoritarianism at school. The one thing I remember is that we had 
a cartoon of a teacher wearing a swastika armband busting a student for 
smoking in the boys’ room. (Eat your hearts out, Brownsville Station!) It 
was that stupid.
To this day, I consider The Lower Left Corner a great success. Eight pages, 
Xeroxed front and back and stapled together… we entered the school each 
armed with a boxful… probably about 80 copies each total, and started 
handing them out selectively, avoiding the jocks and straights (by the way, 
straight used to mean “not hip.”)
We got to homeroom—official start of the school day. The principle came 
over the loudspeaker. “Anyone caught with a copy of the paper called 
The Lower Left Corner will be immediately suspended from school.” 
All eyes on me. Homeroom ends and as the door to the hallway swings 
open, I step out into my first taste of celebrity. All the jocks that usually 
threaten to beat me up or cut my hair off are jostling for a copy of the 
forbidden paper… even thanking me upon receiving. Laughing, I thrust 
the pieces ‘o’ crap into the grasping hands, happy also to get rid of them 
so that I wouldn’t be caught with any copies… and then I waited for the 
administrative consequences.
None were forthcoming. I had beaten the system… and in two ways. 
I’d gotten the administration to act out the very authoritarian impulse 
that we were lamely dithering about in print; and I learned something 
that served me well through the rest of my career as a high school “sixties 
radical. “ If the authorities think you’re political enough to run to the 
ACLU, they’ll leave you alone and bust your intended audience instead!
We created and “printed” one more issue of The Lower Left Corner. As 
I recall, it was on an antiwar theme and we paid more attention to the 
quality of the text and design the second time out. This time, we handed 
them out without any attempted interference. Teachers even used it as a 
source for classroom discussions. And of course… no one cared.
Let the story continue in Fall of 1971. I’m 19. I meet Tommy Hannifin at 
a rally against the killings at Attica State. He’s shouting the not-so-secret 
codeword… YIPPIE! We converge and excitedly share our mutual love of 
the Yippies funny and fun acid-infused, prankster, wild-in-the-streets take 
on The Movement as a Youth Culture Revolution. I tell him that I want 
to create a Binghamton Chapter of the Yippies and start an underground 
newspaper. And so we did.
I should be clear. I had never thought… even for a moment, about 
journalism as a craft and/or a career. It didn’t even occur to me that I 
should think about it in those terms. Indeed, to the constant worry of 
Mom and Dad, I never thought about career at all. I assumed that The 
Revolution would render those issues moot. I simply reached for the 
4.17 Yippie! Abbie Hoffman and Paul 
Krassner hatched the term “Yippie” in 1967 
as a deliberate attempt to reclaim the 
media hype surrounding the less political 
hippie movement. The Yippie publication

often cited as an essential milestone in 
the evolution of the hacker subculture

print medium because it seemed like a tool that was accessible. (It was… 
relatively speaking.) I seem to recall that Tommy, at least, knew something 
about layout—that you had to get these boards, type out the text, get 
visuals and paste it all up. And so, we pasted together Lost In Space, 
Binghamton’s little underground newspaper, ripping off a few frames 
from an underground cartoon titled Nancy Kotex: High School Nurse 
for the front page. This thievery was utterly naïve. The idea of copyright 
and intellectual property was unfamiliar to me—like so many things in 
life that seemed obvious to so many, it hadn’t occurred to me. The cartoon 
just struck us as funny, and when we imagined people getting all upset 
and offended by it, it became twice as funny. And so I learned about the 
double scoop of pleasure you get from prankster humor that confounds 
or freaks people out. You get to laugh at the joke… and then you get to 
laugh at the over-reaction to the joke.
Like The Lower Left Corner, Lost In Space (changed by issue #2 to 
Space because movement types told us Lost In Space sent a negative 
message) was a piece of crap. And unlike the underground papers of the 
bigger urban centers and hip college towns like Madison Wisconsin and 
Ann Arbor Michigan, we had no tributes to George Jackson and Ho 
Chi Minh; we had no quasi-sophisticated neo-Marxian analyses of the 
movement; no major statements from Robin Morgan about the rise of 
militant feminism; and probably not much news. Like The Lower Left 
Corner, Space was locally focused, reflexively against all authority, and 
juvenile. But it was probably a bit more stylishly written… and it certainly 
had a puckish sense of humor.
Let the story continue in 1980. I’m 27 years old and a Junior at the 
State University College at Brockport, New York, near Rochester. (The 
Revolution having left me stranded.) My friend Brian Cotnoir wants to 
start an avant-garde art newspaper. He calls it Black Veins—which comes 
from an interpretation of a line from Lautreamont’s epic proto-surrealist 
misanthropic horror poem Maldoror (Les Chantes de Maldoror)—and 
he signs me on as co-editor. The paper features dark, perversely angled 
bits of poetry and fiction, but I bring something else in. Since the mid 1970s, I have been nursing a growing obsession with the neuro-futurisms 
of Dr. Timothy Leary and Illuminatus author/philosopher Robert Anton 
Wilson.
For the first issue, I have a written exchange with Wilson, performed 
by the soon to be archaic means of letters sent by mail. (As best I recall) 
the exchange essentially involves me wringing my hands that the world 
is a terrible place and that his optimistic weltanschauung may actually 
be a dangerous diversion. (I would later get letters like that myself at 
MONDO 2000 and, generally, respond with dismissive quips intended to 
communicate my lack of commitment to an optimistic—or any—point 
of view.) My letter includes a pretentious, portentous quote from a Village 
Voice review of Hans-Hurgen Syderberg’s 6 hour film, Our Hitler.
And then word comes that Dr. Leary himself is coming to Rochester on 
his “stand up philosophy” tour. Brian, his girlfriend Ellen, myself, and our 
ex-girlfriend Liz pile in Ellen’s car for the 30-minute drive to Rochester

for the Sunday afternoon performance. Our goal is to interview the Dr. 
after the show for the second issue of Black Veins and then to film him. I 
plan to try and incorporate him into an 8mm movie called Armed Camp 
I’m making for a film class. (Incidentally, that’s camp in the Susan Sontag 
sense.) The film involves, among other things, some 20-somethings 
playing poker in pajamas using the Aleister Crowley Thoth Tarot deck and 
then dancing to The Archies “Sugar Sugar” 45 rpm played at 33 (makes 
the vocals sound sort of like Jim Morrison). There is a vague narrative 
structure to this odd little attempt and I have reworked it so that it 
required Timothy Leary to say a few lines.
My posse—myself excluded—is negative about mind-altering drugs and 
cynical about Leary, and this makes me anxious. As we take our seats, 
the end of the Pink Floyd album The Wall blasts out of the loudspeakers 
and the cover of Leary’s book The Intelligence Agents—which shows 
multiple copies of the same baby attempting to climb over a brick wall 
which appears to have no end—is projected onto a screen on stage. 
Then comes Side 2 (The “1984” side) of David Bowie’s Diamond Dogs. 
Given his recent byzantine adventures with prison, exile, revolution, 
and compromise with the powers of state, it seems as if Leary is trying 
to tell us something. To the final echoes of Bowie singing “We want 
you, big brother,” Dr. Leary walks on stage. Liz mutters a bit too loudly, 
“Ohmygod, it’s Johnny Carson!”
The performance is not particularly impressive or funny, but Leary agrees 
to be interviewed. He unleashes that famous laser beam smile on each of 
us, one at a time, and the vibe immediately changes. Instant intimacy. 
Timothy Leary is now our special pal and we’re his co-conspirators. We 
move into the restaurant attached to the club, order drinks and peruse the 
menu. Liz, a slightly moralistic vegetarian, asks Leary if he eats meat. “I’ll 
eat anything!” he says directly to her, smiling. It’s something that has been 
said a million times before by both jackasses and geniuses, but it comes 
out like a blast of freedom. Everybody feels this.
We all have a roaring great time interviewing Leary about life, drugs; 
his hatred of followers, his futurist theories, and the 1980 Democratic 
primaries (“If I’d done a better job, you wouldn’t have all these pastyfaced white guys running around New Hampshire.”) We’re all dazzled, 
feeling like the host of Planet Earth’s party had lifted the velvet rope and 
let us in. As we finish the conversation, Ellen urges me to ask Tim about 
appearing in Armed Camp. I’m feeling shy, but I share the script—such 
as it is—with him and point him at his two-sentence part. “What’s it 
about?” he asks. A bit flustered, I blurt out, “Nothing really.” He laughs 
and looks at my friends. “Thaaat’s wonderfullll, isn’t it? Nothing. Isn’t 
thaaat wonderful?” Everybody laughs, including me. He won’t read the 
lines but he will let me ask him a question and film his response… which 
turns out to be useless for my movie, but a treasure (that I will soon lose) 
nonetheless.
As we wrap up, Tim asks for a ride back to his hotel. He shrewdly 
picks Brian to dismantle and pack up the photo projector he’d uses to 
backdrop his talk. As we head to the car, night has fallen. Liz is pawing 
4.19 “Sugar sugar.” In the late 1960s, 
the fictional cartoon characters in the 
television show Archies released a series 
of pop albums with insanely catchy 
numbers. The song “Sugar Sugar” was

Billboard Magazine.

Dr. Leary, while they both gaze up at the stars. He points and describes 
a constellation or two. In the car, Liz continues to stroke and flirt, 
offering to come up to his hotel. Leary tells her she is very beautiful and 
wonderful, but he’s married. As “Sympathy For the Devil” pops up on 
the mainstream rock radio station, we pull up to a raggedy-ass little hotel 
that’s near the Rochester Airport and the good Dr. takes his leave of us.
Let the story continue in early November 1983. I am 31 years old and 
have just recently moved into a weirdly straight (see above) shared 
household in Mill Valley, California, a ‘burb of San Francisco. The 
house is made up mostly of sedate 50-something recent converts to new 
age philosophies—an oddly pale white man who emanates a bland but 
likeable passivity seems to be the eminence grise of the household scene. 
And then there’s a Hindu Hippie couple around my age that lives in the 
back room. They smoke pot (I can smell it) and they pretty much keep to 
themselves.
I have moved from Brockport, New York to the San Francisco Bay 
Area (starting off in Berkeley) with a “note to self” in my pocket—
the only thing I could write during several months of writer’s block, 
after a briefly successful academic and small town rock and roll career 
as a writer of fiction… and writer and singer of song lyrics. The note 
contains my California to-do list: “Start the Neopsychedelic Wave. Start a 
Neopsychedelic band. Start a Neopsychedelic magazine.”
In late 1980, having written two darkly comic short stories to great local 
academic approval, and even winning a scholastic award (best fiction) for 
one of them (titled “Glib Little Holocausts”); having written darkly comic 
lyrics for a punk-tinged rock band (called “Party Dogs”) and performed 
to some approval in both Brockport and Rochester; and looking ahead 
vaguely to either trying to make a run at a career as a rock and roll 
eccentric or hiding in obscurity as a writing professor; I came in for an 
odd reckoning—an interruption, really. It was a really good LSD trip.
Two days after the murder of John Lennon, laying in a room in a small 
apartment in which the heat pipes played oddly angelic music that had 
gone heretofore unnoticed, my girlfriend Lisa and I laid face to face, took 
the clean 250 microgram doses of liquid LSD-25 we had gotten from the 
colleges’ hippyest Deadhead and made off for the cosmos.
Up until then, even my best trips had been fraught with ambiguity. My 
friends and lovers were weird. My hometown was relatively small… and 
contained parents who worried, and hostile lawmen and jocks who knew 
who I was. There was always at least the hint of trouble or shame—the 
feeling that my neurological nakedness was something to hide and 
someone lurked around the bend ready to give me a bad—or, at least, a 
strange time.
Now, there I was, safe and high and with a girlfriend who I actually liked 
and felt comfortable with, primed by my readings of Leary and Wilson to 
tap into an elegant symmetry, a generosity, even a sense of frivolity in the 
heart of all-that-is.

At first, the acid hit strong. It jolted up and down my spine like kundalini 
lightening, then shooting out the top of my head in a glorious explosive 
overabundance—an excess of multicolor wow! and then it smoothed over 
into an endless and sumptuous multidimensional layer cake of pastels 
filled to the brim with warm congratulations at having arrived. Later, it 
took me into deep space, and the heat pipes, which had been playing a 
pleasant kind of Tuvan throat music drone started, instead, to play John 
Lennon’s hit song, “Starting Over” and, well… the message seemed clear. 
What the Lizard King had said was true: “Everything must be this way.”
The aftermath of the trip found me disastrously happy, playful, 
optimistic, frivolous and energized… and writing about the coming of 
a Neopsychedelic Wave in lyrics and fiction. In the real (small) world of 
Brockport, New York, I’d shifted into a master’s course in Fiction Writing, 
and attempts to give expression to my new head in that context weren’t 
working. What came out was the sort of gibberish that has been produced 
before and aft by so many in the throes of psychedelic wonder—shards 
of flashy words that tried to convey – no, make that impart the energy 
of being aliver than thou to the recipient with FLASHY CAPITALIZED 
WORDS. Finally, after a couple of floundering semesters, I heard the 
siren call: “California is the place you oughta be!” There was really, after 
all, only one state from which to start a Neopsychedelic Wave.
So I’m sitting in the living room here in Mill Valley in 1983 just sort 
of gazing out the window when something bordering on an apparition 
appears. The Hindu Hippies plus their friend, a tall thin man in white 
robes—a visitor who occasionally slinks in and out of their room to use 
the bathroom—are opening a side door, and walking with them into the 
very back yard that I am gazing upon is a tall, thin, curly haired man, 
speaking something not quite audible in a familiar, nasally voice.
I recognize the man. I had attended a lecture he gave at a place in 
Berkeley a few months earlier. It was something about magic mushrooms 
and UFOs. In a nasally voice that reminded me of Jello Biafra, the 
man—Terence McKenna—had woven an astounding linguistic spell, 
rich with references ranging from Learyesque projections of future space 
architectures and superhuman amplifications to McLuhanistic media 
meanderings and, to top it all off, erudite descriptions (damn, why 
couldn’t I do that?) of psychedelic experiences… including one that 
involved something along the lines of forty days and forty nights on 
mushrooms in the Amazonian Rain Forest during which he “channeled” 
a message from the logos that was calling us forward through time and 
using the acceleration of technology and consciousness and social crisis to 
bring us to some kind of psychedelic Singularity in which exteriority and 
interiority would trade places!
Well… far out! But what the fuck is he doing at my house with the 
Hindu Hippies!? Here am I, on cosmic assignment from something or 
other to start the Neopsychedelic Movement and feeling meek and quiet 
and ill prepared and there’s this McKenna guy at my house. They quickly 
retreat into the back room. It takes me a good half hour to work up my 
nerve and tap on the door.
4.21 Food of the Gods. The philosopher 
Terence McKenna (1946-2000) believed 
that low doses of psilocybin-containing 
mushrooms helped our tree-dwelling 
primate ancestors make an evolutionary 
leap to spoken language (“the ability to 
form pictures in another persons’ mind 
through the use of vocal sounds”).
298 Reality Hackers : Appendices : Participants
What happens next is (like an alien probe) wiped from my memory. Let it 
be said—and many will attest to this—that Mr. McKenna always brought 
the powerful fucking weed with him when he came. All I know is that, 
somehow, at the end of the visit, which probably lasted all of an hour, 
Mr. McKenna is handing me a baggie with 6 grams of dried psilocybin 
mushrooms and a joint of his way-too-strong pot and telling me 
(McKenna familiars… hear the nasel): “Eat these on an empty stomach. 
An hour later, go into a darkened room and smoke this joint. That will get 
you where you want to go.”
So it’s about a week later, and it’s Monday, the start of a Thanksgiving 
weeklong break in my job selling season ticket subscriptions by phone 
for various Bay Area arts organizations. I have decided that tonight’s the 
night. I will take the 6 grams of mushrooms late that night and lie in the 
dark in silence in my room and I will make contact with The Others—the 
alien intelligences that Mr. McKenna says are available on the Psilocybin 
frequency (when you take enough)—or I won’t… and either way, it will 
be a groovy trip.
I have decided to try a borderline fast—nothing but toast and water 
(and my morning cup of coffee) all day. It’s a big mistake. It’s around 5 
pm and I’m heading home after strolling into town and I start to pass 
the McDonalds on the corner when the hunger overwhelms me and the 
biological robot commandeers my brain. By the time my brain returns to 
ordinary consciousness, I have downed a bag of Chicken McNuggets and 
a small bag of fries. Now I’m unhappy with myself and I’m deciding that 
I’ve blown the opportunity. No trip tonight.
I get back to the house and, oddly, it’s empty. It’s a large household, yet 
no one is home. A thought grips me. If they all stay away for an hour, 
I have a chance to get off on the mushrooms alone, having the run of 
the house during those energetic, intensely physical early moments that 
occur when you first come on to psychedelics. Then, I can hide out in my 
room with the lights out for the remainder of the trip. The time is nigh. 
I chew down the biggest batch of ‘shrooms in my life by far and I find 
myself pacing the house, nervously. Suddenly, after about 20 minutes, it 
slices through me like a shard of angry glass. A shattering angry splintery 
energy thing is outside me lacerating me and I am in everything’s sights 
and all-that-is is pissed at me. The house cats start scurrying around 
yowling, running furiously, scratching at and trying to climb the walls. 
The suburban Mill Valley street suddenly looms very small and enclosed 
and conservative, and me… Mistra Inappropriate… not in control of 
my basic social signals and I’m now being lacerated by demons from a 
peculiar occult/Rolling Stones mirrorworld for abandoning them back in 
Binghamton, New York. Multiple car engine noises scrape the insides of 
my gut (In reality, it’s around 6 pm, the time when people in the suburbs 
get home from working in San Francisco)—each one of them very likely 
carrying narcotics cops or agents of some hostile control system and, 
worst of all, I see it like it is now… They’re the good guys and I am cast 
out, having done wrong; having eaten magic mushrooms on a corporate 
McDonald’s stomach… heedlessly. I stare out the front window expecting 
incoming—hoping merely that the inevitable death is not too tortuous.

And then it happens. A car actually stops right in front of the house. This 
is it. It’s over! But wait. The doors open and several clearly preoccupied 
corporeal and painfully ordinary humans emerge—all my housemates. 
They are opening doors and the trunk and picking up grocery bags. 
In an instant, things shift. The immediate danger lessens but does not 
disappear. I still may be attacked by angry beings, but right now I have 
another challenge. I have to act normal. I shuffle to the front door and 
open it, thinking that the best strategy is to wander out and offer to carry 
grocery bags. I take one step outside. Can’t handle it. I go back inside 
and close the screen door. Now I’ve given myself away. But the roomies 
walk in the house, preoccupied with their normal activities and blandly 
saying hello, to which I manage a normal sounding reply. All, that is, 
except for the Hindu Hippie guy. He makes a beeline for me and looks 
me right in the eyes. Quietly, he says, “Oh boy. Come with me” and, 
with his girlfriend, leads me by the hand into their back room. I start to 
tell him what I’ve done but he already knows. “You’ve taken Terence’s 
mushrooms.” The thin man in the white robes is lying on his side on a cot 
looking calm. He has been sitting in there all along. They say very little 
at first. They bring me a cup of warm tea; have me lie down on a cot, and 
the Hindu Hippie girl gives me a shoulder rub. I mutter something about 
demons from a Rolling Stones mirrorworld and start to explain about 
the friendship I had with a strange and charismatic guitar player who was 
fanatically and uncannily tapped into Keith Richards almost to the point 
where the evidence suggested a mystical connection and how we spent 
five months together in borderline isolation learning the entire Rolling 
Stones catalogue, and how he played it better than anybody alive except 
maybe Keith (better than Ronnie, by far), and how we talked long into 
the night about the occult dimensions of The Rolling Stones and the gut 
level pagan authenticity of the sex and drugs and rock and roll left hand 
path to enlightenment and how this friendship had all the elements of 
an intense sexual affair but without the sex and he started talking about 
Rimbaud & Verlaine and how it made me self-conscious and I couldn’t 
handle it and then I gave him my song lyrics to start writing originals and 
he said he lost them and laughed at me and I left town and never spoke to 
him again.
And this makes perfect sense to my Hindu Hippie friends. I mean, 
christ… they were California hippies. They were probably at Altamont as 
teenagers! Demons sent from a Rolling Stones mirrorworld made perfect 
sense. And then, as I settled into a state of calm, the thin man in the white 
robes told me his story. Vijaya was a former leader of the American Hare 
Krishna cult. He had left the group because they had started to behave—
as do pretty much all cults—like gangsters, with all the corruption 
and violence that implies. He still believed in Hare Krishna’s brand of 
Hinduism, but he was part of a renegade group of psychedelic Hare 
Krishnas. And the Hare Krishna cultists had tried to kill him… and he 
was hiding out. So here we were, me hiding out from mirrorworld Stones 
demons and him hiding out, ostensibly, from Hare Krishna assassins, both 
of us in the back room of a very bland Mill Valley shared household.
While the LSD trip that had sent me to California was a “good trip” and 
the trip on McKenna’s shrooms was a “bad trip,” they both propelled me 
4.23 Krishna Krishna. In the 1960s and 
1970s, many people – such as the guitarist 
George Harrison – were attracted to the 
Hare Krishna movement.

on. A couple of days after the psilocybin trip, the resolve to go forward 
with the creation of a psychedelic magazine took hold of me. I contacted 
Will Nofke, a new age radio host who had done a series of interviews 
about psychedelics with Albert Hofmann, Timothy Leary, Terence 
McKenna and Andrew Weil on Berkeley’s Pacifica station KPFA, and 
asked him for the tapes to transcribe and publish the content. He sent me 
the tapes and granted me the permission. On New Years Eve—as 1983 
was becoming 1984—I stayed home alone. I finished transcribing the last 
of the tapes—the Leary interview—while watching the avant-garde video 
artist Nam June Paik host a very special New Years Eve 1984 show titled 
Good Morning, Mr. Orwell on PBS’ Alive From Off Center, featuring 
many of my culture heroes: Laurie Anderson, John Cage, Allen Ginsberg, 
and Paik himself. Later I would have my first date with my wife Eve at 
a Nam June Paik exhibit in San Jose, California and I would co-create 
a TV show proposal and sample titled “The R.U. Sirius Show” for the 
consideration of PBS with John Sanborn, the Producer of Alive From 
Off Center. When the show ended, I channel surfed and found Timothy 
Leary on a silly, long forgotten entertainment talk show (I have mercifully 
forgotten the host). It was lame, but still, it was Timmy on network 
TV. A great signifier for the beginning of a new life. As 1984 dawned, 
I started reaching out to find compatriots to be part of a magazine that 
would be called High Frontiers and later Reality Hackers and then finally 
MONDO 2000.

Hackers evolved into the groundbreaking 
Mondo 2000. To learn more about the

AARON DELWICHE
“Interviewed by Sanford Allen”
In the process of promoting the Lennox seminar series, we were thrilled to 
discover Missions Unknown! Authored by John Picacio, Paul Vaugh, and 
Sanford Allen, this first-rate blog focuses on the science fiction, fantasy and 
horror communities in San Antonio. In this piece, Sanford Allen interviewed 
the professor who coordinated the Lennox seminar on which this book is based.
Aaron Delwiche is the curator of the fantastic Reality Hackers lecture 
series going on this spring at Trinity University. Aaron, a professor in the 
school’s communication department, has rounded up a mind-meltingly 
cool gaggle of futurists, technology-focused critics and science fiction 
writers to take part in the series, which is free and open to the public. 
So far, the series has presented talks by io9 editor Annalee Newitz and 
cultural critic Steven Shaviro. Journalist and hacker R.U. Sirius will speak 
at 7 p.m. on Monday, March 29, at Trinity’s Chapman Auditorium. It’s 
pretty clear that Aaron not only knows who the important thinkers are 
when it comes to our rapidly evolving technoculture, he’s obviously done 
some pretty important thinking on it himself.
You’ve assembled an impressive list of lecturers for the Reality Hackers 
series. How did you make your selections?
All five of these speakers are inspiring thinkers who combine critical 
analysis with innovative creative projects. These speakers enjoy theory and 
reflection, but they are equally passionate about using their own hands to 
create blogs, magazines, virtual worlds, short stories, and – with any luck 
– a better future.
What central thread seems to run through all of these thinkers’ work?
The easy answer is that all five thinkers are clever, imaginative, and 
thought-provoking. At a deeper level, these thinkers transcend clichéd 
assumptions that pit knee-jerk technophobes against breathless technoevangelists.
These writers refuse to be mystified by computers and biotechnology, and 
they are quick to criticize aspects of our media landscape. However, they 
also recognize that emerging technologies can be used to make the world 
a happier place. Perhaps most important, their work is characterized by 
compassion for human beings (and other life forms) and a corollary belief 
that ordinary people should be empowered to make decisions about their 
technological future.
The next lecture in the series is R.U. Sirius, editor-in-chief of the 
transhumanist magazine h+ and former editor of the ‘90s magazine 
Mondo 2000. Tell us why people don’t want to miss it.
For decades, R. U. Sirius – a.k.a. Ken Goffman – has been on the 
forefront of science, technology, and social change. His magazine Reality 
4.25 Aaron Delwiche at State of Play 
conference in Singapore (2007).

Hackers (a predecessor to Mondo 2000) inspired this entire lecture series. 
He’s smart, funny, anti-authoritarian, and – much like his friend and co author Timothy Leary – he confronts accelerating technological change 
head-on. Like much of the best science fiction, his books have the ability 
to warp the reader’s perception of reality while simultaneously enlarging 
the reader’s sense of possibility.
If Robert Anton Wilson, Timothy Leary and Philip K. Dick were still 
alive, you can bet that they would be attending Ken’s talk to find out what 
R. U. Sirius has to say about the Singularity.
On the website for the lecture series, you write that “if democracy is 
to continue as a viable alternative to technocracy, the average citizen 
must become more involved in these debates (about technology).” Do 
you think the average citizen, right now, is dangerously underprepared 
for a serious discussion of how emerging technologies will affect their 
lives?
Yes. In his 1960 farewell address, President Eisenhower warned that the 
growing power of scientific and technologic elites threatened the very 
fabric of our democracy. Some on the left interpreted this in conspiratorial 
terms, but Eisenhower was putting his finger on a more intractable 
problem. Citizens are far too willing to believe that only a small 
percentage of the population is capable of understanding the scientific 
creations that are reworking the fabric of society.
Consider cultural phenomena such as the Apple Store, the Geek Squad, 
Big Bang Theory, and those creepy Intel commercials which constantly 
proclaim the intellectual superiority of the company’s employees (e.g. 
“Our joke aren’t like your jokes” “our big ideas aren’t like your big ideas.”)
The difference between the self-proclaimed technological elite of the 
1960s and the self-proclaimed technological elite of the 2010s is largely 
cosmetic. Eisenhower’s technocrats wore lab coats, business suits and 
oversized horn-rimmed glasses, while contemporary technocrats wear 
hipster t-shirts, trendy sneakers and oversized horn-rimmed glasses. 
Yet the underlying message is largely the same: “We, the technological 
elites, are building and creating your future. We are the sponsors of your 
tomorrow.”
There is also an unfortunate tendency to view science and technology 
as domains that are beyond the comprehension of mere mortals. Sure, 
we’re all required to take basic science and computing courses in college 
and high school, but our scientific education typically ends when these 
prerequisites are satisfied. As a result, citizens are far too willing to yield 
decisions about vital scientific matters to the experts.
Really? The experts? The same people who brought us the atomic bomb, 
electroshock therapy, phrenology, lobotomies, the Tuskegee experiment, 
DDT, Thalidomide, and the Hollerith Tabulators used by the Nazis to 
keep track of Jewish prisoners during the holocaust? These are the same 
experts who I’m supposed to trust to make decisions related to genetic 
4.26 Your noun is not as cool as our noun. 
In 2009, Intel initiated the “Sponsors 
of Tomorrow” advertising campaign. Each 
commercial ends with a snappy saying 
that illustrates the intelligence and 
technocratic vision of Intel employees.

engineering, nanotechnology, and Internet privacy? No thanks.
But this sort of paralysis isn’t something that is done to us. It’s something 
that we allow to happen.
Ekaterina Sedia and Annalee Newitz are both pretty well known 
in the sf world. In fact, both are probably better known for their 
involvement in science fiction than science fact. Why is it important 
that sf authors/commentators be involved in these discussions?
Science fiction authors and commentators are vital precisely because they 
bridge this gap between the world of science and the world of civil society. 
The best science fiction writers mine the pages of scientific journals and 
trade publications for ideas, and they use their gift of storytelling to 
encourage the rest of us to reflect upon the social and ethical implications 
of new technologies.
Let me play devil’s advocate here. Some sf authors have a pretty 
good track record for predicting future technology trends, but many 
have widely missed the mark. Isn’t most sf more of a comment on 
contemporary issues and society than a real attempt to predict where 
technology is taking us?
Very true! Among people who don’t read science fiction, there is a 
tendency to equate this wonderful field with television programs such 
as The Jetsons. But, as your readers know full well, that is hardly science 
fiction. The Jetsons was an ideologically loaded futurist counterpoint to 
the Flinstones. Those television programs projected consumer culture, the 
nuclear family, corporate power, and gender roles into the future and the 
past simultaneously – right down to the identical aprons worn by Wilma 
Flinstone and Jane Jetson. But that’s not sf.
The most interesting science fiction is speculative fiction, and my favorite 
writers are those who leverage the imaginative power of the genre as a 
strategy for provoking the reader. Orwell wasn’t saying that totalitarian 
dystopia was inevitable when he wrote 1984; he was warning us to not let 
it happen. Ursula K. LeGuin wasn’t predicting the ascent of androgyny 
when she wrote Left Hand of Darkness; she was prodding us to consider 
the socially constructed nature of gender roles. Cory Doctorow isn’t 
suggesting the death of privacy rights is inevitable in Little Brother; he is 
encouraging us to hack back against those who would crush those rights.
A great example of science fiction’s power is Ekaterina Sedia’s short story 
“The Mind of a Pig,” which you can find online in Apex Magazine. 
Though only a few pages long, her tale raises unsettling issues that 
continue to haunt readers long after the story is finished.
Could you briefly talk about your academic background and how 
it’s led you to examine the emerging technologies that are “reshaping 
collective identities and challenging our understanding of what it 
means to be human?”
4.27 The Jetsons meet The Flinstones: The 
Movie. Essentially the same show set in 
different time periods, The Jetsons and 
The Flintstones both featured amiable but 
clueless fathers, stay-at-home mothers, 
loveable house-pets, and tyrannical 
bosses.

My parents have all been deeply involved in science, technology and 
education, and this has shaped my life path. My Mom and Dad were 
graduate students in the 1970s; she studied biochemistry and became 
fascinated with DNA while he studied computer science and helped build 
out the precursors to the Internet. They often brought me to school with 
them, and they taught me how to use the computer mainframe as a kid. 
My stepmother is passionate educator – a middle school principal who 
taught social studies for years. My stepfather, who has worked with NASA 
since the 1960s, spearheaded efforts to convert the Ames military base 
into a center for interdisciplinary scientific research. With these sorts of 
role models – and all four of my parents have been hugely influential – 
it was inevitable that I would end up teaching, researching and writing 
about emerging technologies. And don’t even get me started about my 
grandmother!
I studied political science as an undergraduate, but quickly realized 
that the field of communication is an ideal home for anyone interested 
in the social implications of new technology. (My doctorate is in 
communication.) These days, if you want to study web development, 
user-centered computer programming, game design, film, social 
media, participatory subcultures, Internet law, or on-line journalism, 
communication is the place to be.
How important was reading/seeing sf books, movies and the like in 
leading you down this academic path?
Life without science fiction and fantasy books, movies, games, and 
graphic novels would be empty, drab and miserable. It’s almost impossible 
to contemplate.
How difficult was it to convince Trinity to fund this series of lectures 
by mavericks, sf weirdos and self-described geeks?
Not at all difficult. One of the many great things about Trinity University 
is the institution’s liberal arts mentality and the administration’s 
willingness to fund a wide range of creative projects. It’s important to note 
that the Martha, David and Bagby Lennox Foundation provided financial 
support for this series. The Lennox Foundation has funded several seminar 
series on topics ranging from the role of poetry in contemporary society to 
aesthetics and the philosophy of music.
Historically, Trinity University has recognized that some of the most 
interesting discoveries emerge from the margins. Statisticians are obsessed 
with developing mathematically sound generalizations about the “mean” 
and “median” of the population, but statistical outliers are just as 
important – often much more so – than those data points captured within 
the “normal curve.” Of course science fiction fans already understand the 
limitations of normality and the value of statistical outliers.
4.28 Trinity University. Consistently 
recognized as one of the top liberal arts 
colleges in the western United States, 
Trinity University is located near 
downtown San Antonio. With approximately 
3,000 students, and a 10:1 student faculty ratio, Trinity University offers 
a stimulating environment for teaching 
and research. The book you hold in your 
hand is just one example of the creative 
freedom nurtured on the Trinity campus.

And, now, the question we throw at all of our Q&A subjects: Can you 
list your five favorite sf, fantasy or horror books, films and comics/
graphic novels?
It is so difficult to reduce the list to just five items! (Ed. note—We actually 
meant five of each category, but we admire your discipline!)
•	 Philip K. Dick, Radio Free Albemuth, 1982. (Book)
•	 Ian M. Banks, Player of Games, 1988. (Book)
•	 Andrew Niccol, Gattaca, 1997. (Film)
•	 Bill Willingham and Mark Buckingham, Fables (On-going comic 
book)
•	 Paul Kantner with Grace Slick, David Crosby, Jerry Garcia and 
Mickey Hart (among others), Blows against the Empire, 1970. (It’s a 
Hugo-nominated science fiction rock and roll fantasy about a rag tag bag of hippies who escape oppression by hijacking a starship and 
trekking across the universe with “free minds, free bodies, and free 
music.” What’s not to love?!)
Also, who can forget Harry Potter, Alice in Wonderland and Star Wars?
4.29 We are egg snatchers. Blows Against 
the Empire—a concept album released by 
Paul Kantner and Jefferson Starship in 
1970—includes contributions from Grace 
Slick, Jerry Garcia, David Crosby, and 
Graham Nash among others.
