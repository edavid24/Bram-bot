## Overview
This is a project for RPI's Extended Cognition course. Our goal it to create a language model that is able to in some meaningful way produce content that might appear in a Cognitive Science department class at RPI. We will be training the model on slides and content from actual classes as well as on papers and research in relevant fields.

## Goals
- Learn basic Machine Learning concepts
- Learn how to implement them in Pytorch
- Build a database for input
- Build a transformer model and train it on data
- Test trained model
- Fine tune and tweak
- (Optional) make model publicly availabe

## Models
We will be using a form of a transformer model which is what all mainstream generative large language models (LLM) use.
